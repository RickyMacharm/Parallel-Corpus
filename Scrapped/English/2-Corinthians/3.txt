3  Are we starting to recommend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some men, letters of recommendation to you or from you?
2  You yourselves are our letter,+ inscribed on our hearts and known and being read by all mankind.
3  For you are shown to be a letter of Christ written by us as ministers,+ inscribed not with ink but with the spirit of a living God, not on stone tablets+ but on fleshly tablets, on hearts.+ 
4  We have this sort of confidence toward God through the Christ.
5  Not that we of ourselves are adequately qualified to consider that anything comes from us, but our being adequately qualified comes from God,+
6  who has indeed adequately qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant,+ not of a written code,+ but of spirit; for the written code condemns to death,+ but the spirit makes alive.+ 
7  Now if the code that administers death and that was engraved in letters on stones+ came with such glory that the sons of Israel could not gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face,+ a glory that was to be done away with,
8  why should the administering of the spirit+ not be with even greater glory?+
9  For if the code administering condemnation+ was glorious,+ how much more glorious would be the administering of righteousness!+
10  In fact, even what had once been made glorious has been stripped of glory because of the glory that excels it.+
11  For if what was to be done away with was brought in with glory,+ how much greater would be the glory of what remains!+ 
12  Since we have such a hope,+ we are using great freeness of speech,
13  and not doing what Moses did when he would put a veil over his face+ so that the sons of Israel might not gaze intently at the end of what was to be done away with.
14  But their minds were dulled.+ For to this present day, the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read,+ because it is taken away only by means of Christ.+
15  In fact, to this day whenever Moses is read,+ a veil lies upon their hearts.+
16  But when one turns to Jehovah,* the veil is taken away.+
17  Now Jehovah* is the Spirit,+ and where the spirit of Jehovah* is, there is freedom.+
18  And all of us, while we with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah,* are transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another,* exactly as it is done by Jehovah* the Spirit.*+
