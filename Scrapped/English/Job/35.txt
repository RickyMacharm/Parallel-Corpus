35  E·liʹhu continued his response: 
 2  “Are you so convinced that you are right that you would say,‘I am more righteous than God’?+ 
 3  For you say, ‘What does it matter to you?* Am I better off than if I had sinned?’+ 
 4  I will reply to youAnd to your companions+ with you. 
 5  Look up to heaven and see,Observe the clouds,+ which are high above you. 
 6  If you sin, how do you hurt him?+ If your transgressions multiply, what do you do to him?+ 
 7  If you are righteous, what do you give him;What does he receive from you?+ 
 8  Your wickedness affects only a human like yourself,And your righteousness, a son of man. 
 9  People cry out when under great oppression;They cry for relief from the domination* of the powerful.+ 
10  But no one says, ‘Where is God, my Grand Maker,+The one causing songs to be sung in the night?’+ 
11  He teaches us+ more than the beasts of the earth,+And he makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens. 
12  People cry out, but he does not answer,+Because of the pride of the wicked.+ 
13  Surely God does not hear an empty cry;*+The Almighty does not pay attention to it. 
14  How much less, then, when you complain that you do not see him!+ Your legal case is before him, so you should wait anxiously for him.+ 
15  For he has not angrily called for an accounting;Nor has he taken note of your extreme rashness.+ 
16  Job opens his mouth wide in vain;He multiplies words without knowledge.”+
