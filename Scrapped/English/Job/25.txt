25  Bilʹdad+ the Shuʹhite said in reply: 
 2  “Rulership and fearsome might are his;He establishes peace in heaven.* 
 3  Can his troops be numbered? Upon whom does his light not rise? 
 4  So how can mortal man be righteous before God,+Or how can one born of a woman be innocent?*+ 
 5  Even the moon is not brightAnd the stars are not pure in his eyes,
 6  How much less so mortal man, who is a maggot,And a son of man, who is a worm!”
