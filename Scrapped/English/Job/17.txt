17  “My spirit has been broken, my days have been extinguished;The graveyard awaits me.+ 
 2  Mockers surround me,+And my eye must gaze at* their rebellious behavior. 
 3  Please accept my security, and keep it with you. Who else will shake hands with me and pledge in my behalf?+ 
 4  For you have concealed discernment from their heart;+That is why you do not exalt them. 
 5  He may offer to share with his friends,While the eyes of his children fail. 
 6  He has made me an object of scorn* among the peoples,+So that I became one in whose face they spit.+ 
 7  From anguish my eyes grow dim,+And all my limbs are but a shadow. 
 8  Upright people stare in amazement at this,And the innocent one is disturbed over the godless.* 
 9  The righteous one keeps holding fast to his way,+And the one with clean hands grows stronger.+ 
10  However, you may all come and resume your arguing,For I have not found anyone wise among you.+ 
11  My days are finished;+My plans, the desires of my heart, have been shattered.+ 
12  They keep turning night into day,Saying, ‘Light must be near because it is dark.’ 
13  If I wait, the Grave* will become my home;+I will spread out my bed in darkness.+ 
14  I will call out to the pit,*+ ‘You are my father!’ To the maggot, ‘My mother and my sister!’ 
15  Where, then, is my hope?+ Who can see hope for me? 
16  It* will go down to the barred gates of the Grave*When we all descend together into the dust.”+
