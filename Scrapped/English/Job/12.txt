12  Then Job said in reply: 
 2  â€œSurely you are the people who know,*And wisdom will die out with you! 
 3  But I too have understanding.* I am not inferior to you. Who does not know these things? 
 4  I have become a laughingstock to my companions,+One calling to God for an answer.+ A righteous and blameless man is a laughingstock. 
 5  The carefree person has contempt for calamity,Thinking it is only for those whose feet are unsteady.* 
 6  The tents of robbers are at peace,+And those who provoke God are secure,+Those who have their god in their hands. 
 7  However, ask, please, the animals, and they will instruct you;Also the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you. 
 8  Or give consideration* to the earth, and it will instruct you;And the fish of the sea will declare it to you. 
 9  Who among all these does not knowThat the hand of Jehovah has done this? 
10  In his hand is the life of every living thing*And the spirit* of every human.*+ 
11  Does not the ear test out wordsAs the tongue* tastes food?+ 
12  Is not wisdom found among the aged,+And does not understanding come with a long life? 
13  With him there are wisdom and mightiness;+He has counsel and understanding.+ 
14  When he tears something down, it cannot be rebuilt;+What he has shut, no man can open. 
15  When he withholds the waters, everything dries up;+When he sends them out, they overwhelm the earth.+ 
16  With him there are strength and practical wisdom;+To him belong the one going astray and the one leading astray;
17  He makes counselors go barefoot,*And he makes fools of judges.+ 
18  He loosens the bonds imposed by kings,+And he binds a belt around their waist. 
19  He makes priests walk barefoot,+And he overthrows those who are firmly established in power;+
20  He deprives trusted advisers of speechAnd takes away the sensibleness of old men;*
21  He pours out contempt upon nobles,+And he makes powerful ones weak;*
22  He reveals deep things from the darkness,+And he brings deep darkness into the light;
23  He makes nations grow great in order to destroy them;He enlarges nations, that he may lead them into exile. 
24  He takes away the understanding* of the leaders of the peopleAnd makes them wander in trackless wastelands.+ 
25  They grope in darkness,+ where there is no light;He makes them wander about like drunken men.+
