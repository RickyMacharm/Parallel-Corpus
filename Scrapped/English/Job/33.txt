33  “But now, Job, please hear my words;Listen to everything I say. 
 2  Look, please! I must open my mouth;My tongue* must speak. 
 3  My words declare the uprightness of my heart,+And my lips sincerely tell what I know. 
 4  God’s own spirit made me,+And the Almighty’s own breath brought me to life.+ 
 5  Reply to me if you are able;Present your arguments before me; take your position. 
 6  Look! I am just like you before the true God;From the clay I too was shaped.+ 
 7  So no fear of me should terrify you,And no pressure from me should overwhelm you. 
 8  But you said in my hearing,Yes, I kept hearing these words,
 9  ‘I am pure, without transgression;+I am clean, without error.+ 
10  But God finds reasons to oppose me;He considers me his enemy.+ 
11  He puts my feet in stocks;He scrutinizes all my paths.’+ 
12  But you are not right in saying this, so I will answer you: God is far greater than mortal man.+ 
13  Why do you complain against Him?+ Is it because he did not answer all your words?+ 
14  For God speaks once and a second time,But no one pays attention,
15  In a dream, a vision of the night,+When deep sleep falls upon peopleWhile they sleep in their beds. 
16  Then he uncovers their ears+And impresses* his instruction upon them,
17  To turn a person away from wrongdoing+And to protect a man from pride.+ 
18  God spares his soul* from the pit,*+His life from perishing by the sword.* 
19  A person is also reproved by pain on his bedAnd by the constant distress of his bones,
20  So that his very being* loathes bread,And he* rejects even fine food.+ 
21  His flesh wastes away from sight,And his bones that were hidden now protrude.* 
22  His soul* draws near to the pit;*His life to those who bring death. 
23  If there is a messenger* for him,One advocate out of a thousand,To tell to man what is upright,
24  Then God shows him favor and says,‘Spare him from going down into the pit!*+ I have found a ransom!+ 
25  Let his flesh become fresher* than in youth;+Let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.’+ 
26  He will entreat God,+ who will accept him,And he will see His face with shouts of joy,And He will restore His righteousness to mortal man. 
27  That person will declare* to men,‘I have sinned+ and distorted what is right,But I did not receive what I deserved.* 
28  He has redeemed my soul* from going into the pit,*+And my life will see the light.’ 
29  Indeed, God does all these thingsTwice, three times, for a man,
30  To bring him* back from the pit,*So that he may be enlightened with the light of life.+ 
31  Pay attention, Job! Listen to me! Keep silent, and I will continue speaking. 
32  If you have something to say, reply to me. Speak, for I want to prove you right. 
33  If you have nothing to say, you should listen to me;Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
