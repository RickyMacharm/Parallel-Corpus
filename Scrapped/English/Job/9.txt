9  Job said in reply: 
 2  “For a fact I know that this is so. But how can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?+ 
 3  If someone wishes to argue with Him,*+That one could not answer one of His questions in a thousand. 
 4  He is wise in heart and mighty in power.+ Who can resist him and come off uninjured?+ 
 5  He moves* mountains without anyone knowing it;He overturns them in his anger. 
 6  He shakes the earth out of its place,So that its pillars tremble.+ 
 7  He commands the sun not to shineAnd seals off the light of the stars;+
 8  He spreads out the heavens by himself,+And he treads upon the high waves of the sea.+ 
 9  He made the Ash,* the Keʹsil,* and the Kiʹmah constellations,*+And the constellations of the southern sky;*
10  He does great and unsearchable things,+Wonderful things that cannot be counted.+ 
11  He passes by me, and I cannot see him;He moves past me, but I do not discern him. 
12  When he snatches something, who can resist him? Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’+ 
13  God will not restrain his anger;+Even the helpers of Raʹhab*+ will bow down to him. 
14  How much more when I answer himMust I choose my words carefully to argue with him! 
15  Even if I were in the right, I would not answer him.+ I could only plead for mercy from my judge.* 
16  If I call out to him, will he answer me? I do not believe that he will listen to my voice,
17  For he crushes me with a stormAnd multiplies my wounds for no reason.+ 
18  He does not let me catch my breath;He keeps filling me with bitter things. 
19  If it is a matter of power, he is the strong one.+ If it is a matter of justice, he says: ‘Who can call me to account?’* 
20  If I were in the right, my own mouth would condemn me;Even if I keep my integrity,* he will declare me guilty.* 
21  Even if I keep my integrity,* I am not confident about myself;*I reject* this life of mine. 
22  It is all the same. That is why I say,‘He destroys the innocent* and the wicked alike.’ 
23  If a flash flood should cause sudden death,He would mock at the despair of the innocent. 
24  The earth has been handed over to the wicked;+He covers the eyes* of its judges. If it is not he, then, who is it? 
25  Now my days are swifter than a runner;+They run away without seeing good. 
26  They glide by like reed boats,Like eagles that swoop down on their prey. 
27  If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,I will change my expression and be cheerful,’ 
28  I would still be afraid because of all my pains,+And I know you would not find me innocent. 
29  I would be found guilty.* So why should I struggle in vain?+ 
30  If I wash myself in water from melting snow,And I cleanse my hands in lye,*+
31  Then you would dip me in a pit,So that even my own garments would detest me. 
32  For he is not a man like me that I may answer him,That we should go to court together.+ 
33  There is no person to decide* between us,Who could serve as our judge.* 
34  If he would stop beating me*And not let his terror frighten me,+
35  Then I would speak to him unafraid,For it is not in me to speak out of fear.
