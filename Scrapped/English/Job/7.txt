7  “Is not the life of mortal man on earth like compulsory labor,And are not his days like those of a hired worker?+ 
 2  Like a slave, he longs for the shadow,And like a hired worker, he waits for his wages.+ 
 3  Thus I have been assigned months of futilityAnd nights of misery have been counted out for me.+ 
 4  When I lie down I ask, ‘When will I get up?’+ But as the night drags on, I toss restlessly until the dawning of the day.* 
 5  My flesh is covered with maggots and clods of dirt;+My skin is full of scabs and pus.+ 
 6  My days go by more quickly than a weaver’s shuttle,+And they come to an end without hope.+ 
 7  Remember that my life is wind,+That my eye will never again see happiness.* 
 8  The eye that sees me now will see me no more;Your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone.+ 
 9  Like a cloud that fades and vanishes,The one who goes down to the Grave* does not come back up.+ 
10  He will not return again to his house,And his place will acknowledge him no more.+ 
11  Therefore, I will not restrain my mouth. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;I will complain in my bitter distress!*+ 
12  Am I the sea or a sea monster,That you should set a guard over me? 
13  When I say, ‘My couch will comfort me;My bed will help ease my misery,’ 
14  Then you terrify me with dreamsAnd frighten me with visions,
15  So that I* would choose suffocation,Yes, death rather than this body of mine.*+ 
16  I loathe my life;+ I do not want to go on living. Leave me alone, for my days are like a breath.+ 
17  What is mortal man that you should concern yourself with himAnd fix your attention* on him?+ 
18  Why do you inspect him every morningAnd test him every moment?+ 
19  Will you not look away from meAnd leave me alone long enough to swallow my saliva?+ 
20  If I have sinned, how could I harm you, the Observer of mankind?+ Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you? 
21  Why do you not pardon my transgressionAnd excuse my error? For soon I will lie down in the dust,+And you will look for me, but I will be gone.”
