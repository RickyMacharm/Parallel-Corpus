23  Job said in reply: 
 2  â€œEven today I will complain stubbornly;*+My strength is exhausted because of my sighing. 
 3  If only I knew where to find God!+ I would go to his place of dwelling.+ 
 4  I would present my case before himAnd fill my mouth with arguments;
 5  I would learn how he would answer meAnd take note of what he says to me. 
 6  Would he contend with me using his great power? No, surely he would give me a hearing.+ 
 7  There the upright one could set matters straight with him,And I would be acquitted once and for all by my Judge. 
 8  But if I go east, he is not there;And I return and I cannot find him. 
 9  When he is working on the left, I cannot look upon him;Then he turns to the right, but I still do not see him. 
10  But he knows the path I have taken.+ After he has tested me, I will come out as pure gold.+ 
11  My feet have closely followed his footsteps;I have kept to his way without deviating.+ 
12  I have not departed from the commandment of his lips. I have treasured up his sayings+ even more than what was required of me.* 
13  When he is determined, who can resist him?+ When he* wants to do something, he does it.+ 
14  For he will carry out completely what has been determined* for me,And he has many such things in store. 
15  That is why I am anxious because of him;When I think about him, my fear grows. 
16  God has made me fainthearted,And the Almighty has made me afraid. 
17  But I have not yet been silenced by the darknessNor by the gloom that has covered my face.
