37  “At this my heart poundsAnd leaps from its place. 
 2  Listen carefully to the rumbling of his voiceAnd the thunder that comes from his mouth. 
 3  He unleashes it under the entire heavensAnd sends his lightning+ to the ends of the earth. 
 4  After that is a roaring sound;He thunders with a majestic voice,+And he does not hold it back when his voice is heard. 
 5  God thunders with his voice+ in a wonderful way;He does great things that are beyond our understanding.+ 
 6  For he says to the snow, ‘Fall to the earth,’+ And to the downpour of rain, ‘Pour down mightily.’+ 
 7  God puts a stop to all human activity*So that every mortal man will know His work. 
 8  The wild animals go into their densAnd remain in their lairs. 
 9  The storm wind blows from its chamber,+And the cold comes from the north winds.+ 
10  By the breath of God, the ice is produced,+And the broad waters are frozen solid.+ 
11  Yes, he weighs down the clouds with moisture;He scatters his lightning+ in the clouds;
12  They swirl around where he directs them;They carry out whatever he commands+ on the surface of the inhabited earth.* 
13  Whether it is for punishment*+ or for the sake of the landOr for loyal love, he causes it to happen.+ 
14  Listen to this, Job;Stop and consider carefully the wonderful works of God.+ 
15  Do you know how God controls* the cloudsAnd how he causes the lightning to flash from his cloud? 
16  Do you know how the clouds float?+ These are the wonderful works of the One perfect in knowledge.+ 
17  Why does your clothing become hotWhen the earth is still because of the south wind?+ 
18  Can you, with him, spread out* the skies+As solid as a metal mirror? 
19  Tell us what we should say to him;We cannot answer because we are in the dark. 
20  Should he be told that I want to speak? Or has anyone said something that should be communicated to him?+ 
21  They cannot even see the light,*Though it is bright in the sky,Until a wind passes by and clears away the clouds. 
22  Out of the north comes golden splendor;God’s majesty+ is awe-inspiring. 
23  Understanding the Almighty is beyond our reach;+He is great in power,+And he never violates his justice+ and abundant righteousness.+ 
24  Therefore, people should fear him.+ For he does not favor any who think that they are wise.”*+
