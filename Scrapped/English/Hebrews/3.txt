3  Consequently, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling,*+ consider the apostle and high priest whom we acknowledge*—Jesus.+
2  He was faithful to the One who appointed him,+ just as Moses also was in all the house of that One.+
3  For he* is counted worthy of more glory+ than Moses, since the one who constructs a house has more honor than the house itself.
4  Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God.
5  Now Moses was faithful as an attendant in all the house of that One as a testimony* of the things that were to be spoken afterward,
6  but Christ was faithful as a son+ over God’s house. We are His house+ if, indeed, we hold on firmly to our freeness of speech and the hope of which we boast down to the end. 
7  Therefore, just as the holy spirit says,+ “Today if you listen to his voice,
8  do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger, as in the day of testing in the wilderness,+
9  where your forefathers put me to the test and tried me, despite seeing my works for 40 years.+
10  This is why I became disgusted with this generation and said: ‘They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not come to know my ways.’
11  So I swore in my anger: ‘They will not enter into my rest.’”+ 
12  Beware, brothers, for fear there should ever develop in any one of you a wicked heart lacking faith by drawing away from the living God;+
13  but keep on encouraging one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,”+ so that none of you should become hardened by the deceptive power of sin.
14  For we actually become partakers of* the Christ only if we hold firmly down to the end the confidence we had at the beginning.+
15  As it is said, “Today if you listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger.”+ 
16  For who heard and yet provoked him to bitter anger? Was it not, in fact, all those who went out of Egypt under Moses?+
17  Moreover, with whom did God become disgusted for 40 years?+ Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?+
18  And to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest? Was it not to those who acted disobediently?
19  So we see that they could not enter in because of lack of faith.+
