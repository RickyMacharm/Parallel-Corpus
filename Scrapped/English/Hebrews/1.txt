1  Long ago God spoke to our forefathers by means of the prophets on many occasions and in many ways.+
2  Now at the end of these days he has spoken to us by means of a Son,+ whom he appointed heir of all things,+ and through whom he made the systems of things.*+
3  He is the reflection of God’s glory+ and the exact representation of his very being,+ and he sustains all things by the word of his power. And after he had made a purification for our sins,+ he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.+
4  So he has become better than the angels+ to the extent that he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs.+ 
5  For example, to which one of the angels did God ever say: “You are my son; today I have become your father”?+ And again: “I will become his father, and he will become my son”?+
6  But when he again brings his Firstborn+ into the inhabited earth, he says: “And let all of God’s angels do obeisance to him.”* 
7  Also, he says about the angels: “He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers*+ a flame of fire.”+
8  But about the Son, he says: “God is your throne+ forever and ever, and the scepter of your Kingdom is the scepter of uprightness.*
9  You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you+ with the oil of exultation more than your companions.”+
10  And: “At the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands.
11  They will perish, but you will remain; and just like a garment, they will all wear out,
12  and you will wrap them up just as a cloak, as a garment, and they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never come to an end.”+ 
13  But about which of the angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet”?+
14  Are they not all spirits for holy service,*+ sent out to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?
