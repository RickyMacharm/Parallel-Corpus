6  Does any one of you who has a dispute with another+ dare to go to court before unrighteous men, and not before the holy ones?
2  Or do you not know that the holy ones will judge the world?+ And if the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to try very trivial matters?
3  Do you not know that we will judge angels?+ Then why not matters of this life?
4  If, then, you do have matters of this life to be tried,+ is it the men looked down on in the congregation whom you assign as judges?
5  I am speaking to move you to shame. Is there not one wise man among you who is able to judge between his brothers?
6  Instead, brother goes to court against brother, and before unbelievers at that! 
7  Really, it is already a defeat for you when you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged?+ Why do you not rather let yourselves be defrauded?
8  Instead, you wrong and defraud, and your brothers at that! 
9  Or do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit God’s Kingdom?+ Do not be misled.* Those who are sexually immoral,*+ idolaters,+ adulterers,+ men who submit to homosexual acts,+ men who practice homosexuality,*+
10  thieves, greedy people,+ drunkards,+ revilers,* and extortioners will not inherit God’s Kingdom.+
11  And yet that is what some of you were. But you have been washed clean;+ you have been sanctified;+ you have been declared righteous+ in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God. 
12  All things are lawful* for me, but not all things are advantageous.+ All things are lawful for me, but I will not let myself be controlled* by anything.
13  Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will bring both of them to nothing.+ The body is not for sexual immorality* but for the Lord,+ and the Lord is for the body.
14  But God raised up the Lord+ and will also raise us up out of death+ through his power.+ 
15  Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?+ Should I, then, take the members of the Christ away and join them to a prostitute? By no means!
16  Do you not know that anyone who is joined to a prostitute is one body with her? For “the two,” says he, “will be one flesh.”+
17  But whoever is joined to the Lord is one with him in spirit.+
18  Flee from sexual immorality!*+ Every other sin that a man may commit is outside his body, but whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body.+
19  Do you not know that your body is the temple+ of the holy spirit within you, which you have from God?+ Also, you do not belong to yourselves,+
20  for you were bought with a price.+ By all means, glorify God+ in your body.+
