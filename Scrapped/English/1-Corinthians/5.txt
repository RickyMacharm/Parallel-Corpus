5  Actually sexual immorality*+ is reported among you, and such immorality* as is not even found among the nations—of a man living with* his father’s wife.+
2  And are you proud of it? Should you not rather mourn,+ so that the man who committed this deed should be taken away from your midst?+
3  Although absent in body, I am present in spirit, and I have already judged the man who has done this, as if I were actually with you.
4  When you are gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and knowing that I am with you in spirit along with the power of our Lord Jesus,
5  you must hand such a man over to Satan+ for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.+ 
6  Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven ferments* the whole batch of dough?+
7  Clear away the old leaven so that you may be a new batch, inasmuch as you are free from ferment.* For, indeed, Christ our Passover lamb+ has been sacrificed.+
8  So, then, let us keep the festival,+ not with old leaven, nor with leaven of badness and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 
9  In my letter I wrote you to stop keeping company* with sexually immoral people,*
10  not meaning entirely with the sexually immoral people* of this world+ or the greedy people or extortioners or idolaters. Otherwise, you would actually have to get out of the world.+
11  But now I am writing you to stop keeping company*+ with anyone called a brother who is sexually immoral* or a greedy person+ or an idolater or a reviler* or a drunkard+ or an extortioner,+ not even eating with such a man.
12  For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Do you not judge those inside,
13  while God judges those outside?+ “Remove the wicked person from among yourselves.”+
