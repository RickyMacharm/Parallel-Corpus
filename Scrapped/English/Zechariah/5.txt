5  Again I looked up, and I saw a flying scroll.
2  He asked me: “What do you see?” I replied: “I see a flying scroll, which is 20 cubits* long and 10 cubits wide.” 
3  Then he said to me: “This is the curse that is going out over the face of all the earth, because everyone who steals,+ as written on its one side, has gone unpunished; and everyone who makes a sworn oath,+ as written on its other side, has gone unpunished.
4  ‘I have sent it out,’ declares Jehovah of armies, ‘and it will enter into the house of the thief and into the house of the one who makes a false oath in my name; and it will remain inside that house and consume it and its timbers and its stones.’” 
5  Then the angel who was speaking with me came forward and said to me: “Look up, please, and see what is going out.” 
6  So I asked: “What is it?” He replied: “This is the eʹphah container* that is going out.” He continued: “This is their appearance in all the earth.”
7  And I saw that the round lid of lead was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting inside the container.
8  So he said: “This is Wickedness.” Then he threw her back into the eʹphah container, after which he thrust the lead weight over its mouth. 
9  Then I looked up and saw two women coming forward, and they were soaring in the wind. They had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the container between the earth and heaven.
10  So I asked the angel who was speaking with me: “Where are they taking the eʹphah container?” 
11  He replied: “To the land of Shiʹnar*+ to build her a house; and when it is prepared, she will be deposited there in her proper place.”
