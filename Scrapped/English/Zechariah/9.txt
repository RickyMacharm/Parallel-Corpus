9  A pronouncement: “The word of Jehovah is against the land of Haʹdrach,And Damascus is its target*+—For Jehovah’s eye is on mankind+And on all the tribes of Israel—
 2  And against Haʹmath,+ which borders on her,And against Tyre+ and Siʹdon,+ for they are so wise.+ 
 3  Tyre built herself a rampart.* She piled up silver like dustAnd gold like the dirt of the streets.+ 
 4  Look! Jehovah will take away her possessions,And he will strike down her army into the sea;*+And she will be consumed in the fire.+ 
 5  Ashʹke·lon will see it and be afraid;Gazʹa will feel great anguish,Also Ekʹron, because her hope is put to shame. A king will perish from Gazʹa,And Ashʹke·lon will not be inhabited.+ 
 6  An illegitimate son will settle in Ashʹdod,And I will do away with the pride of the Phi·lisʹtine.+ 
 7  I will remove the bloodstained things from his mouthAnd the disgusting things from between his teeth,And he will be left remaining for our God;And he will become like a sheikh* in Judah,+And Ekʹron like the Jebʹu·site.+ 
 8  I will encamp as a guard* for my house,+So that there will be no one passing through and no one returning;And no taskmaster* will pass through again,+For now I have seen it* with my eyes. 
 9  Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion. Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem. Look! Your king is coming to you.+ He is righteous, bringing salvation,*Humble+ and riding on a donkey,On a colt,* the foal of a female donkey.+ 
10  I will take away the war chariot from Eʹphra·imAnd the horse from Jerusalem. The battle bow will be taken away. And he will proclaim peace to the nations;+His rulership will be from sea to seaAnd from the River* to the ends of the earth.+ 
11  As for you, O woman, by the blood of your covenant,I will send your prisoners out of the waterless pit.+ 
12  Return to the stronghold, you prisoners with hope.+ Today I am telling you,‘I will repay to you, O woman, a double portion.+ 
13  For I will bend* Judah as my bow. The bow I will fill with Eʹphra·im,*And I will awaken your sons, O Zion,Against your sons, O Greece,And I will make you like a warrior’s sword.’ 
14  Jehovah will be seen over them,And his arrow will go out like lightning. The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will sound the horn,+And he will advance with the windstorms of the south. 
15  Jehovah of armies will defend them,And they will devour and subdue the slingstones.+ They will drink and be boisterous, as if with wine;And they will be filled like the bowl,Like the corners of the altar.+ 
16  Jehovah their God will save them in that dayAs the flock of his people;+For they will be like the gemstones of a crown* glittering over his soil.+ 
17  For how great his goodness is,+And how great his handsomeness is! Grain will make the young men thrive,And new wine the virgins.”+
