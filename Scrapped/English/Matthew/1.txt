1  The book of the history* of Jesus Christ,* son of David,+ son of Abraham:+ 
 2  Abraham became father to Isaac;+Isaac became father to Jacob;+Jacob became father to Judah+ and his brothers;
 3  Judah became father to Peʹrez and Zeʹrah+ by Taʹmar;Peʹrez became father to Hezʹron;+Hezʹron became father to Ram;+
 4  Ram became father to Am·minʹa·dab;Am·minʹa·dab became father to Nahʹshon;+Nahʹshon became father to Salʹmon;
 5  Salʹmon became father to Boʹaz by Raʹhab;+Boʹaz became father to Oʹbed by Ruth;+Oʹbed became father to Jesʹse;+
 6  Jesʹse became father to David+ the king. David became father to Solʹo·mon+ by the wife of U·riʹah;
 7  Solʹo·mon became father to Re·ho·boʹam;+Re·ho·boʹam became father to A·biʹjah;A·biʹjah became father to Aʹsa;+
 8  Aʹsa became father to Je·hoshʹa·phat;+Je·hoshʹa·phat became father to Je·hoʹram;+Je·hoʹram became father to Uz·ziʹah;
 9  Uz·ziʹah became father to Joʹtham;+Joʹtham became father to Aʹhaz;+Aʹhaz became father to Hez·e·kiʹah;+
10  Hez·e·kiʹah became father to Ma·nasʹseh;+Ma·nasʹseh became father to Aʹmon;+Aʹmon became father to Jo·siʹah;+
11  Jo·siʹah+ became father to Jec·o·niʹah+ and to his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.+ 
12  After the deportation to Babylon, Jec·o·niʹah became father to She·alʹti·el;She·alʹti·el became father to Ze·rubʹba·bel;+
13  Ze·rubʹba·bel became father to A·biʹud;A·biʹud became father to E·liʹa·kim;E·liʹa·kim became father to Aʹzor;
14  Aʹzor became father to Zaʹdok;Zaʹdok became father to Aʹchim;Aʹchim became father to E·liʹud;
15  E·liʹud became father to El·e·aʹzar;El·e·aʹzar became father to Matʹthan;Matʹthan became father to Jacob;
16  Jacob became father to Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born,+ who is called Christ.+ 
17  All the generations, then, from Abraham until David were 14 generations; from David until the deportation to Babylon, 14 generations; from the deportation to Babylon until the Christ, 14 generations. 
18  But this is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place. During the time his mother Mary was promised in marriage to Joseph, she was found to be pregnant by holy spirit*+ before they were united.
19  However, because her husband Joseph was righteous and did not want to make her a public spectacle, he intended to divorce her secretly.+
20  But after he had thought these things over, look! Jehovah’s* angel appeared to him in a dream, saying: “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take your wife Mary home, for what has been conceived* in her is by holy spirit.+
21  She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus,*+ for he will save his people from their sins.”+
22  All of this actually came about to fulfill what was spoken by Jehovah* through his prophet, saying:
23  “Look! The virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and they will name him Im·manʹu·el,”+ which means, when translated, “With Us Is God.”+ 
24  Then Joseph woke up from his sleep and did as the angel of Jehovah* had directed him, and he took his wife home.
25  But he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son,+ and he named him Jesus.+
