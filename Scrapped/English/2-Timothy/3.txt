3  But know this, that in the last days+ critical times hard to deal with will be here.
2  For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal,
3  having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness,
4  betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God,
5  having an appearance of godliness but proving false to its power;+ and from these turn away.
6  From among these arise men who slyly work their way into households and captivate weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires,
7  always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth. 
8  Now in the way that Janʹnes and Jamʹbres opposed Moses, so these also go on opposing the truth. Such men are completely corrupted in mind, disapproved as regards the faith.
9  Nevertheless, they will make no further progress, for their folly* will be very plain to all, as it was with those two men.+
10  But you have closely followed my teaching, my course of life,+ my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,
11  the persecutions and sufferings such as I experienced in Antioch,+ in I·coʹni·um,+ in Lysʹtra.+ I endured these persecutions, and the Lord rescued me from them all.+
12  In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.+
13  But wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.+ 
14  You, however, continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe,+ knowing from whom you learned them
15  and that from infancy+ you have known the holy writings,+ which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.+
16  All Scripture is inspired of God+ and beneficial for teaching,+ for reproving, for setting things straight,* for disciplining in righteousness,+
17  so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.
