17  Better is a piece of dry bread where there is peace*+Than a house full of feasting* along with quarreling.+ 
 2  A servant with insight will rule over a son who acts shamefully;He will share in the inheritance as one of the brothers. 
 3  The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold,+But Jehovah is the examiner of hearts.+ 
 4  A wicked man pays attention to hurtful speech,And a deceptive man listens to a malicious tongue.+ 
 5  Whoever mocks the poor insults his Maker,+And whoever rejoices over another’s disaster will not go unpunished.+ 
 6  Grandsons* are a crown to the aged,And fathers* are the glory of their sons.* 
 7  Upright* speech does not befit a fool.+ How much less does false speech befit a ruler!*+ 
 8  A gift is like a precious stone* to its owner;+Everywhere he turns, it brings him success.+ 
 9  Whoever forgives* a transgression seeks love,+But the one who keeps harping on a matter separates close friends.+ 
10  A rebuke makes a deeper impression on one having understanding+Than striking a stupid person a hundred times.+ 
11  A bad man seeks only rebellion,But a cruel messenger will be sent to punish him.+ 
12  Better to meet a bear bereaved of her cubsThan to encounter someone stupid in his foolishness.+ 
13  If anyone repays bad for good,Bad will not depart from his house.+ 
14  Beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate;*Before the quarrel breaks out, take your leave.+ 
15  Anyone who acquits the wicked one and anyone who condemns the righteous one+—Both of them are detestable to Jehovah. 
16  What good is it that the stupid one has the means to acquire wisdomWhen he has no heart for acquiring it?*+ 
17  A true friend shows love at all times+And is a brother who is born for times of distress.+ 
18  A man lacking good sense* shakes hands and agreesTo put up security* in the presence of his neighbor.+ 
19  The one who loves conflict loves transgression.+ Anyone who makes his entryway high invites a crash.+ 
20  The one who is crooked at heart will not find success,*+And the one who speaks deceitfully will fall into ruin. 
21  The one who fathers a stupid child will experience grief;And the father of a senseless child has no joy.+ 
22  A joyful heart is good medicine,*+But a crushed spirit saps one’s strength.*+ 
23  A wicked man will take a bribe in secret*To pervert the course of justice.+ 
24  Wisdom is directly in front of the discerning person,But the eyes of the stupid wander to the ends of the earth.+ 
25  A stupid son brings grief to his fatherAnd heartache* to the one who gave birth to him.+ 
26  To punish* the righteous one is not good,And to flog honorable people goes against what is right. 
27  A man of knowledge restrains his words,+And a discerning man will remain calm.*+ 
28  Even a fool who keeps silent will be considered wise,And the one who seals his lips, discerning.
