21  A king’s heart is like streams of water in Jehovah’s hand.+ He directs it wherever He pleases.+ 
 2  All of a man’s ways seem right to him,+But Jehovah examines the hearts.*+ 
 3  To do what is right and justIs more pleasing to Jehovah than a sacrifice.+ 
 4  Haughty eyes and an arrogant heart—The lamp that guides the wicked is sin.+ 
 5  The plans of the diligent surely lead to success,*+But all who are hasty surely head for poverty.+ 
 6  Gaining treasures by a lying tongueIs like a vanishing mist, a deadly snare.*+ 
 7  The violence of the wicked will sweep them away,+For they refuse to act with justice. 
 8  The way of a guilty man is crooked,But the activity of the pure man is upright.+ 
 9  Better to dwell on a corner of the roofThan in the same house with a quarrelsome* wife.+ 
10  The wicked man* craves what is bad;+He shows no favor toward his neighbor.+ 
11  When a ridiculer is punished, the inexperienced become wiser,And when a wise person receives insight, he gains knowledge.*+ 
12  The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked one;He overthrows the wicked to their ruin.+ 
13  Whoever stops up his ear to the cry of the lowly oneWill himself call and not be answered.+ 
14  A secret gift subdues anger,+And a hidden bribe,* fierce rage. 
15  It is a joy for the righteous one to act with justice,+But it is something terrible to those who practice evil. 
16  The man who strays from the way of insightWill rest in the company of those powerless in death.+ 
17  The one who loves having a good time* will come to poverty;+The one who loves wine and oil will not grow rich. 
18  The wicked one is a ransom for the righteous one,And the treacherous one will be taken in place of the upright.+ 
19  Better to dwell in the wildernessThan with a quarrelsome* and irritable wife.+ 
20  Precious treasure and oil are found in the house of the wise,+But the stupid man will squander* what he has.+ 
21  Whoever pursues righteousness and loyal loveWill find life, righteousness, and glory.+ 
22  A wise man can scale* the city of the mightyAnd undermine the strength in which they trust.+ 
23  The one guarding his mouth and his tongueKeeps himself* out of trouble.+ 
24  A presumptuous, arrogant braggart is what you callThe man who acts with reckless presumptuousness.+ 
25  What the lazy man craves will put him to death,For his hands refuse to work.+ 
26  All day long he greedily craves,But the righteous one gives, holding nothing back.+ 
27  The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable.+ How much more when he offers it with evil intent!* 
28  A lying witness will perish,+But the man who listens will testify with success.* 
29  The wicked man puts on a bold face,+But it is the upright one whose course is sure.*+ 
30  There is no wisdom, nor discernment, nor counsel in opposition to Jehovah.+ 
31  The horse is prepared for the day of battle,+But salvation belongs to Jehovah.+
