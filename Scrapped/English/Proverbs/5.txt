5  My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Listen carefully* to my discernment,+
 2  So that you may guard your thinking abilitiesAnd safeguard knowledge with your lips.+ 
 3  For the lips of a wayward* woman drip like a honeycomb,+And her mouth is smoother than oil.+ 
 4  But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood+And as sharp as a two-edged sword.+ 
 5  Her feet descend into death. Her steps lead straight to the Grave.* 
 6  She gives no thought to the path of life. Her course wanders, but she does not know where. 
 7  Now, my sons, listen to meAnd do not turn away from what I am saying. 
 8  Stay far away from her;Do not go near the entrance of her house,+
 9  So that you may not give your dignity to others+Nor reap years of what is cruel;+
10  So that strangers may not drain your resources*+And what you labored for go to the house of a foreigner. 
11  Otherwise, you will groan at the end of your lifeWhen your flesh and body waste away+
12  And you say: “How I hated discipline! How my heart despised reproof! 
13  I did not listen to the voice of my instructorsOr pay attention to my teachers. 
14  I have come to the brink of complete ruinIn the midst of the entire congregation.”*+ 
15  Drink water from your own cisternAnd flowing* water from your own well.+ 
16  Should your springs be dispersed outside,Your streams of water in the public squares?+ 
17  Let them be for you alone,And not for strangers with you.+ 
18  May your own fountain* be blessed,And may you rejoice with the wife of your youth,+
19  A loving doe, a graceful mountain goat.*+ Let her breasts satisfy* you at all times. May you be captivated by her love constantly.+ 
20  So why, my son, should you be captivated by a wayward* womanOr embrace the bosom of an immoral* woman?+ 
21  For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah;He examines all his paths.+ 
22  The wicked one is ensnared by his own errors,And he will be caught in the ropes of his own sin.+ 
23  He will die for lack of disciplineAnd go astray because of his excessive foolishness.
