25  These also are the proverbs of Solʹo·mon,+ which the men of Hez·e·kiʹah+ the king of Judah transcribed:* 
 2  It is the glory of God to keep a matter secret,+And the glory of kings is to search through a matter. 
 3  As the heavens are high and the earth is deep,So the heart of kings is unsearchable. 
 4  Remove the dross from the silver,And it will emerge completely refined.+ 
 5  Remove the wicked one from the king’s presence,And his throne will be firmly established in righteousness.+ 
 6  Do not honor yourself before the king,+And do not take a place among the prominent,+
 7  For it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,” Than to humiliate you in the presence of a noble.+ 
 8  Do not rush into a legal dispute,For what will you do later if your neighbor humiliates you?+ 
 9  Plead your case with your neighbor,+But do not reveal what you were told confidentially,*+
10  So that the one listening will not put you to shameAnd you spread a bad report* that cannot be recalled. 
11  Like apples of gold in silver carvings*Is a word spoken at the right time.+ 
12  Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine goldIs a wise reprover to the receptive ear.+ 
13  Just like the coldness of snow on the day of harvestIs a faithful messenger to those who sent him,For he refreshes his master.*+ 
14  Like clouds and wind that bring no rainIs a man who boasts about a gift never given.*+ 
15  By patience a commander is won over,And a gentle* tongue can break a bone.+ 
16  If you find honey, eat only what you need,For if you take too much, you may vomit it up.+ 
17  Rarely set foot in your neighbor’s house,So that he does not get tired of you and hate you. 
18  Like a war club and a sword and a sharp arrowIs a man bearing false witness against his neighbor.+ 
19  Like a broken tooth or an unsteady footIs confidence in an unreliable* person in times of trouble. 
20  Like one who removes a garment on a cold dayAnd like vinegar poured on soda*Is the one who sings songs to a gloomy heart.+ 
21  If your enemy* is hungry, give him bread to eat;If he is thirsty, give him water to drink,+
22  For you will be heaping burning coals on his head,*+And Jehovah will reward you. 
23  The north wind brings a downpour,And a gossiping tongue brings an angry face.+ 
24  Better to dwell on a corner of the roofThan in the same house with a quarrelsome* wife.+ 
25  Like cold water on a tired soul*Is a good report from a distant land.+ 
26  Like a muddied spring and a ruined wellIs a righteous person who gives in to* a wicked one. 
27  It is not good to eat too much honey,+Nor is it glorious to seek one’s own glory.+ 
28  As a city broken through, without a wall,Is the man who cannot control his temper.*+
