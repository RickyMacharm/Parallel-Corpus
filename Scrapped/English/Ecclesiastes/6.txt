6  There is another tragedy* that I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:
2  The true God gives a man riches and material possessions and glory, so that he lacks nothing that he desires;* yet the true God does not enable him to enjoy them, although a stranger may enjoy them. This is futility and a severe affliction.
3  If a man should become a father a hundred times and live for many years and reach old age, yet he* does not enjoy his good things before he reaches the grave,* I must say that a stillborn child is better off than he is.+
4  For this one came in vain and went away in darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness.
5  Even though he never saw the sun or knew anything, he is still better off* than the former one.+
6  What is the benefit of living a thousand years twice over but not experiencing enjoyment? Do not all go to the same place?+ 
7  All the hard work of a man is to fill his mouth;+ yet his appetite* is never satisfied.
8  For what advantage does the wise one have over the stupid one,+ or of what benefit is it that the poor man knows how to survive?*
9  Better to enjoy what the eyes see than to wander after oneâ€™s desires.* This too is futility, a chasing after the wind. 
10  Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is; and he is not able to dispute* with the one more powerful than he.
11  The more words,* the more futility; and what advantage do they bring to man?
12  Who knows what is best for a man to do in life during the few days of his futile life, which he spends like a shadow?+ For who can tell man what will happen under the sun after he is gone?
