1  The song of songs,* which is Solʹo·mon’s:+ 
 2  “May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,For your expressions of affection are better than wine.+ 
 3  The fragrance of your oils is pleasant.+ Your name is like a fragrant oil poured out.+ That is why the young women love you. 
 4  Take me with you;* let us run. The king has brought me into his interior rooms! Let us be joyful and rejoice in you. Let us praise* your expressions of affection more than wine. Rightly they* love you. 
 5  I am dark,* but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem,Like the tents of Keʹdar,+ like the tent cloths+ of Solʹo·mon. 
 6  Do not stare at me because I am swarthy,Because the sun has gazed upon me. The sons of my mother were angry with me;They appointed me the keeper of the vineyards,But my own vineyard I did not keep. 
 7  Tell me, you whom I love* so much,Where you pasture your flock,+Where you have them lie down at midday. Why should I be like a woman wrapped in a veil*Among the flocks of your companions?” 
 8  “If you do not know, O most beautiful of women,Go follow the tracks of the flockAnd pasture your young goats next to the tents of the shepherds.” 
 9  “I liken you, my beloved, to a* mare among the chariots of Pharʹaoh.+ 
10  Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,*Your neck with strings of beads. 
11  We will make for you gold ornaments*Studded with silver.” 
12  “While the king sits at his round table,My perfume*+ gives off its fragrance. 
13  My dear one is to me like a fragrant bag of myrrh+Spending the night between my breasts. 
14  My dear one is to me like a cluster of henna+Among the vineyards of En-gedʹi.”+ 
15  “Look! You are beautiful, my beloved. Look! You are beautiful. Your eyes are those of doves.”+ 
16  “Look! You are beautiful,* my dear one, and delightful.+ Our bed is among the foliage. 
17  The beams of our house* are cedars,Our rafters are juniper trees.
