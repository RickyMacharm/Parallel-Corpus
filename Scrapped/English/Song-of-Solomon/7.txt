7  “How beautiful your feet are in your sandals,O noble daughter! The curves of your thighs are like ornaments,The work of an artisan’s hands. 
 2  Your navel is a round bowl. May it never lack mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat,Encircled by lilies. 
 3  Your two breasts are like two fawns,The twins of a gazelle.+ 
 4  Your neck+ is like an ivory tower.+ Your eyes+ are like the pools in Heshʹbon,+By the gate of Bath-rabʹbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebʹa·non,Which looks toward Damascus. 
 5  Your head crowns you like Carʹmel,+And the locks of your hair*+ are like purple wool.+ The king is captivated* by the flowing tresses. 
 6  How beautiful you are, and how pleasant you are,O beloved girl, above all exquisite delights! 
 7  Your stature is like a palm tree,And your breasts are like date clusters.+ 
 8  I said, ‘I will climb the palm treeTo take hold of its stalks of fruit.’ May your breasts be like clusters of grapes,Your breath as fragrant as apples,
 9  And your mouth* like the best wine.” “May it go down smoothly for my dear one,Softly flowing over the lips of those asleep. 
10  I am my dear one’s,+And his desire is for me. 
11  Come, O my dear one,Let us go out to the fields;Let us lodge among the henna plants.+ 
12  Let us rise early and go to the vineyardsTo see if the vine has sprouted,*If the blossoms have opened,+If the pomegranates are in bloom.+ There I will express my affection for you.+ 
13  The mandrakes+ give off their fragrance;At our doors are all sorts of choice fruits.+ The new as well as the old,O my dear one, I have kept in store for you.
