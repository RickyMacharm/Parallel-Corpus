15  The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:
2  “Son of man, how does the wood of the vine compare with that of any other tree or branch from the trees of the forest?
3  Can a pole from it be used to do work? Or do people make a peg from it to hang utensils on?
4  Look! It is thrown into the fire for fuel, and the fire consumes both ends and scorches the middle. Is it now fit for any work?
5  Even when it was whole, it could not be used for anything. How much less useful it will be when the fire has consumed and scorched it!” 
6  “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Just like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given as fuel for the fire, so I will deal with the inhabitants of Jerusalem.+
7  I have set my face against them. They have escaped from the fire, but fire will consume them. And you will have to know that I am Jehovah when I set my face against them.’”+ 
8  “‘And I will make the land desolate+ because they have acted unfaithfully,’+ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”
