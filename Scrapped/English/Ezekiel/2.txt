2  He then said to me: “Son of man,* stand up on your feet that I may speak with you.”+
2  When he spoke to me, spirit came into me and made me stand up on my feet+ so that I could hear the One speaking to me. 
3  He went on to say to me: “Son of man, I am sending you to the people of Israel,+ to rebellious nations that have rebelled against me.+ They and their forefathers have transgressed against me down to this very day.+
4  I am sending you to sons who are defiant* and hardhearted,+ and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says.’
5  As for them, whether they listen or refuse to listen—for they are a rebellious house+—they will certainly know that a prophet was among them.+ 
6  “But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them,+ and do not be afraid of their words, although you are surrounded by briars and thorns*+ and are dwelling among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words,+ and do not be terrified by their faces,+ for they are a rebellious house.
7  You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or not, for they are a rebellious people.+ 
8  “But you, son of man, listen to what I am telling you. Do not become rebellious like this rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.”+ 
9  When I looked, I saw a hand stretched out to me,+ and in it I saw a written scroll.*+
10  When he spread it out before me, it had writing on both front and back.+ Dirges* and mourning and wailing were written on it.+
