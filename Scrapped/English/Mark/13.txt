13  As he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him: “Teacher, see! what wonderful stones and buildings!”+
2  However, Jesus said to him: “Do you see these great buildings? By no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.”+ 
3  As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives with the temple in view, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately:
4  “Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are to come to a conclusion?”+
5  So Jesus began to tell them: “Look out that nobody misleads you.+
6  Many will come on the basis of my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and will mislead many.
7  Moreover, when you hear of wars and reports of wars, do not be alarmed; these things must take place, but the end is not yet.+ 
8  “For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom;+ there will be earthquakes in one place after another; there will also be food shortages.+ These are a beginning of pangs of distress.+ 
9  “As for you, look out for yourselves. People will hand you over to local courts,+ and you will be beaten in synagogues+ and be put on the stand before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them.+
10  Also, in all the nations, the good news has to be preached first.+
11  And when they are taking you to hand you over, do not be anxious beforehand about what to say; but whatever is given you in that hour, say this, for you are not the ones speaking, but the holy spirit is.+
12  Furthermore, brother will deliver brother over to death, and a father a child, and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.+
13  And you will be hated by all people on account of my name.+ But the one who has endured* to the end+ will be saved.+ 
14  “However, when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation+ standing where it should not be (let the reader use discernment), then let those in Ju·deʹa begin fleeing to the mountains.+
15  Let the man on the housetop not come down nor go inside to take anything out of his house;
16  and let the man in the field not return to the things behind to pick up his outer garment.
17  Woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days!+
18  Keep praying that it may not occur in wintertime;
19  for those days will be days of a tribulation+ such as has not occurred from the beginning of the creation that God created until that time, and will not occur again.+
20  In fact, unless Jehovah* had cut short the days, no flesh would be saved. But on account of the chosen ones whom he has chosen, he has cut short the days.+ 
21  “Then, too, if anyone says to you, ‘See! Here is the Christ,’ or, ‘See! There he is,’ do not believe it.+
22  For false Christs and false prophets will arise+ and will perform signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, the chosen ones.
23  You, then, watch out.+ I have told you all things beforehand. 
24  “But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,+
25  and the stars will be falling out of heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
26  And then they will see the Son of man+ coming in the clouds with great power and glory.+
27  And then he will send out the angels and will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from earth’s extremity to heaven’s extremity.+ 
28  “Now learn this illustration from the fig tree: Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near.+
29  Likewise also you, when you see these things happening, know that he is near at the doors.+
30  Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen.+
31  Heaven and earth will pass away,+ but my words will by no means pass away.+ 
32  “Concerning that day or the hour nobody knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father.+
33  Keep looking, keep awake,+ for you do not know when the appointed time is.+
34  It is like a man traveling abroad who left his house and gave the authority to his slaves,+ to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch.+
35  Keep on the watch, therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming,+ whether late in the day or at midnight or before dawn* or early in the morning,+
36  in order that when he comes suddenly, he does not find you sleeping.+
37  But what I say to you, I say to all: Keep on the watch.”+
