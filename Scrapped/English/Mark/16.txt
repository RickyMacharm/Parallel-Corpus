16  So when the Sabbath+ was over, Mary Magʹda·lene, Mary+ the mother of James, and Sa·loʹme bought spices in order to come and apply them to his body.+
2  And very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen, they came to the tomb.*+
3  They were saying to one another: “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb for us?”
4  But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, although it was very large.+
5  When they entered into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were stunned.
6  He said to them: “Do not be stunned.+ You are looking for Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ who was executed on the stake. He was raised up.+ He is not here. Look, here is the place where they laid him.+
7  But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galʹi·lee.+ You will see him there, just as he told you.’”+
8  So when they came out, they fled from the tomb, trembling and overwhelmed with emotion. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were in fear.*+
