27  Joʹtham+ was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Je·ruʹshah the daughter of Zaʹdok.+
2  He kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes, just as his father Uz·ziʹah had done,+ except that he did not invade the temple of Jehovah.+ But the people were still acting ruinously.
3  He built the upper gate of Jehovah’s house,+ and he did much building on the wall of Oʹphel.+
4  He also built cities+ in the mountainous region of Judah,+ and he built fortified places+ and towers+ in the wooded areas.
5  He waged war against the king of the Amʹmon·ites+ and eventually prevailed against them, so that the Amʹmon·ites gave him in that year 100 silver talents,* 10,000 cor measures* of wheat, and 10,000 of barley. The Amʹmon·ites also paid this to him in the second and third years.+
6  So Joʹtham kept growing strong, for he established* his ways before Jehovah his God. 
7  As for the rest of the history of Joʹtham, all his wars and his ways, it is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah.+
8  He was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem.+
9  Then Joʹtham was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David.+ And his son Aʹhaz became king in his place.+
