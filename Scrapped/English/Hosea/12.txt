12  “Eʹphra·im is feeding on wind. He chases after the east wind all day long. He multiplies lies and violence. They make a covenant with As·syrʹi·a+ and take oil to Egypt.+ 
 2  Jehovah has a legal case against Judah;+He will call for an accounting against Jacob according to his ways,And he will repay him according to his deeds.+ 
 3  In the womb he seized his brother by the heel,+And with his vigor he contended with God.+ 
 4  He kept contending with an angel and prevailed. He wept and begged for his favor.”+ He found him at Bethʹel, and there He spoke with us,+
 5  Jehovah the God of armies,+Jehovah is his memorial name.*+ 
 6  “So return to your God,+Maintain loyal love and justice,+And always hope in your God. 
 7  But in the hand of the tradesman* are deceptive scales;He loves to defraud.+ 
 8  Eʹphra·im keeps saying, ‘Indeed, I have become rich;+I have found wealth.+ And in all my toil, they will not find anything wrong or sinful.’ 
 9  But I am Jehovah your God from* the land of Egypt.+ I will again make you dwell in tentsAs in the days of an appointed time.* 
10  I spoke to the prophets,+I multiplied their visions,And I spoke parables through the prophets. 
11  With Gilʹe·ad there has been deception*+ and untruth. In Gilʹgal they have sacrificed bulls,+And their altars are like piles of stones in the furrows of the field.+ 
12  Jacob ran away to the territory* of Aʹram;*+Israel+ served there for a wife,+And for a wife he guarded sheep.+ 
13  By a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up from Egypt,+And by a prophet he was guarded.+ 
14  Eʹphra·im has caused bitter offense;+His bloodguilt remains on him;His Lord will repay him for his reproach.”+
