11  “When Israel was a boy, I loved him,+And out of Egypt I called my son.+ 
 2  The more they* called them,The more they went away from them.+ They kept sacrificing to the Baʹal images+And offering sacrifices to the graven images.+ 
 3  But it was I who taught Eʹphra·im to walk,+ taking them in my arms;+And they did not acknowledge that I had healed them. 
 4  With the ropes of men* I kept drawing them, with the cords of love;+And I was to them like one lifting a yoke from their jaws,And I gently brought food to each one. 
 5  They will not return to the land of Egypt, but As·syrʹi·a will be their king,+Because they refused to return to me.+ 
 6  And a sword will whirl against his cities+And destroy his bars and devour them because of their schemes.+ 
 7  My people are bent on unfaithfulness to me.+ Though they called them upward,* no one rises up. 
 8  How can I give you up, O Eʹphra·im?+ How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I treat you like Adʹmah? How can I make you like Ze·boiʹim?+ I have had a change of heart;At the same time my compassions are stirred.*+ 
 9  I will not vent my burning anger. I will not destroy Eʹphra·im again,+For I am God and not man,The Holy One in your midst;And I will not come against you in fury. 
10  They will walk after Jehovah, and he will roar like a lion;+When he roars, his sons will come trembling from the west.+ 
11  They will tremble like a bird when they come out of Egypt,Like a dove out of the land of As·syrʹi·a;+And I will settle them in their houses,” declares Jehovah.+ 
12  “Eʹphra·im has surrounded me with lies,And the house of Israel with deceit.+ But Judah still roams* with God,And he is faithful to the Most Holy One.”+
