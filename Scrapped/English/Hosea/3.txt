3  Then Jehovah said to me: “Go once again, love the woman who is loved by another man and is committing adultery,+ just as Jehovah loves the people of Israel+ while they turn to other gods+ and love raisin cakes.”* 
2  So I purchased her for myself for 15 silver pieces and a hoʹmer measure* and a half of barley.
3  Then I said to her: “You will remain mine for many days. You must not commit prostitution,* and you must not have relations with another man, and I will behave the same way toward you.”* 
4  It is because for a long time* the people of Israel will dwell without a king,+ without a prince, without a sacrifice, without a pillar, and without an ephʹod+ and teraphim statues.*+
5  Afterward the people of Israel will come back and look for Jehovah their God+ and for David their king,+ and they will come trembling to Jehovah and to his goodness in the final part of the days.+
