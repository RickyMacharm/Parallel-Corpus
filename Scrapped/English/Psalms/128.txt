128  Happy is everyone who fears Jehovah,+Who walks in His ways.+ 
 2  You will eat what your hands worked hard to produce. You will be happy and will enjoy prosperity.+ 
 3  Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house;+Your sons will be like shoots of an olive tree around your table. 
 4  Look! That is how the man who fears JehovahWill be blessed.+ 
 5  Jehovah will bless you from Zion. May you see Jerusalem prosper all the days of your life+
 6  And see the sons of your sons. May there be peace upon Israel.
