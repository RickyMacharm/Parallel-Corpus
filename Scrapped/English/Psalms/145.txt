145  I will exalt you, O my God the King,+I will praise your name forever and ever.+ 
 2  All day long I will praise you;+I will praise your name forever and ever.+ 
 3  Jehovah is great and most worthy of praise;+His greatness is unsearchable.*+ 
 4  Generation after generation will praise your works;They will tell about your mighty acts.+ 
 5  Of the glorious splendor of your majesty they will speak+And on your wonderful works I will meditate. 
 6  They will speak about your awe-inspiring deeds,*And I will declare your greatness. 
 7  They will bubble over as they recall your abundant goodness,+And they will shout joyfully because of your righteousness.+ 
 8  Jehovah is compassionate* and merciful,+Slow to anger and great in loyal love.+ 
 9  Jehovah is good to all,+And his mercy is evident in all his works. 
10  All your works will glorify you, O Jehovah,+And your loyal ones will praise you.+ 
11  They will proclaim the glory of your kingship+And speak about your mightiness,+
12  To make known to men your mighty acts+And the glorious splendor of your kingship.+ 
13  Your kingship is an eternal kingship,And your dominion endures throughout all generations.+ 
14  Jehovah supports all who are falling+And raises up all who are bowed down.+ 
15  All eyes look hopefully to you;You give them their food in its season.+ 
16  You open your handAnd satisfy the desire of every living thing.+ 
17  Jehovah is righteous in all his ways+And loyal in all that he does.+ 
18  Jehovah is near to all those calling on him,+To all who call on him in truth.*+ 
19  He satisfies the desire of those who fear him;+He hears their cry for help, and he rescues them.+ 
20  Jehovah guards all those who love him,+But all the wicked he will annihilate.+ 
21  My mouth will declare the praise of Jehovah;+Let every living thing* praise his holy name forever and ever.+
