149  Praise Jah!* Sing to Jehovah a new song;+Praise him in the congregation of the loyal ones.+ 
 2  Let Israel rejoice in its Grand Maker;+Let the sons of Zion be joyful in their King. 
 3  Let them praise his name with dancing+And sing praises* to him, accompanied by the tambourine and the harp.+ 
 4  For Jehovah takes pleasure in his people.+ He adorns the meek with salvation.+ 
 5  Let the loyal ones exult in glory;Let them shout for joy upon their beds.+ 
 6  Let the songs praising God be in their throat,And a two-edged sword be in their hand,
 7  To execute vengeance on the nationsAnd punishment on the peoples,
 8  To bind their kings with shacklesAnd their nobles with iron fetters,
 9  To execute the judgment written against them.+ This honor belongs to all his loyal ones. Praise Jah!*
