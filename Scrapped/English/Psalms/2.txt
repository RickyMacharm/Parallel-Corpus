2  Why are the nations agitatedAnd the peoples muttering* an empty thing?+ 
 2  The kings of the earth take their standAnd high officials gather together* as one+Against Jehovah and against his anointed one.*+ 
 3  They say: “Let us tear off their shacklesAnd throw off their ropes!” 
 4  The One enthroned in the heavens will laugh;Jehovah will scoff at them. 
 5  At that time he will speak to them in his angerAnd terrify them in his burning anger,
 6  Saying: “I myself have installed my king+On Zion,+ my holy mountain.” 
 7  Let me proclaim the decree of Jehovah;He said to me: “You are my son;+Today I have become your father.+ 
 8  Ask of me, and I will give nations as your inheritanceAnd the ends of the earth as your possession.+ 
 9  You will break them with an iron scepter,+And you will smash them like a piece of pottery.”+ 
10  So now, you kings, show insight;Accept correction,* you judges of the earth. 
11  Serve Jehovah with fear,And rejoice with trembling. 
12  Honor* the son,+ or God* will become indignantAnd you will perish from the way,+For His anger flares up quickly. Happy are all those taking refuge in Him.
