142  With my voice I call to Jehovah for help;+With my voice I plead with Jehovah for favor. 
 2  Before him I pour out my concern;Before him I tell about my distress+
 3  When my spirit* fails within me. Then you watch my roadway.+ In the path where I walk,They hide a trap for me. 
 4  Look at my right hand and seeThat no one cares about* me.+ There is nowhere I can flee;+No one is concerned about me.* 
 5  I call to you, O Jehovah, for help. I say: “You are my refuge,+All I have* in the land of the living.” 
 6  Pay attention to my cry for help,For I have been brought very low. Rescue me from my persecutors,+For they are stronger than I am. 
 7  Bring me* out of the dungeonTo praise your name. May the righteous gather around meBecause you deal kindly with me.
