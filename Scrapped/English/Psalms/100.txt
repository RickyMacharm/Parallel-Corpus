100  Shout in triumph to Jehovah, all the earth.+ 
 2  Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.+ Come into his presence with joyful shouting. 
 3  Know* that Jehovah is God.+ He is the one who made us, and we belong to him.*+ We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.+ 
 4  Come into his gates with thanksgiving,+Into his courtyards with praise.+ Give thanks to him; praise his name.+ 
 5  For Jehovah is good;+His loyal love endures forever,And his faithfulness through all generations.+
