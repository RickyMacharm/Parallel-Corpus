54  O God, save me by your name,+And defend me*+ with your power. 
 2  O God, hear my prayer;+Pay attention to the words of my mouth. 
 3  For strangers rise up against me,And ruthless men seek my life.*+ They have no regard for God.*+ (Selah) 
 4  Look! God is my helper;+Jehovah is with those supporting me.* 
 5  He will repay my foes+ with their own evil;In your faithfulness, put an end to* them.+ 
 6  I will sacrifice to you+ willingly. I will praise your name, O Jehovah, for it is good.+ 
 7  For he saves me from every distress,+And I will look in triumph on my enemies.+
