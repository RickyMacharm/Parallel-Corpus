28  To you I keep calling, O Jehovah my Rock;+Do not turn a deaf ear to me. If you keep silent toward me,I will become like those going down to the pit.*+ 
 2  Hear my pleas when I cry to you for helpAs I lift up my hands toward the innermost room of your sanctuary.+ 
 3  Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those practicing what is hurtful,+Those who are speaking words of peace with their fellow man while evil is in their hearts.+ 
 4  Pay them back for their deeds,+According to their evil practices. Repay them for the work of their hands,According to what they have done.+ 
 5  For they pay no attention to the activities of Jehovah,+Nor to the work of his hands.+ He will tear them down and not build them up. 
 6  May Jehovah be praised,For he has heard my pleas for help. 
 7  Jehovah is my strength+ and my shield;+In him my heart trusts.+ I have received his help, and my heart rejoices,So I will praise him with my song. 
 8  Jehovah is a strength for his people;He is a stronghold, bringing grand salvation to his anointed one.+ 
 9  Save your people, and bless your inheritance.+ Shepherd them and carry them in your arms forever.+
