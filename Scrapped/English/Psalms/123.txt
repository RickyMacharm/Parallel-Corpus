123  To you I raise my eyes,+You who are enthroned in the heavens. 
 2  As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,And the eyes of a servant girl to the hand of her mistress,So our eyes look to Jehovah our God+Until he shows us favor.+ 
 3  Show us favor, O Jehovah, show us favor,For we have had our full share of contempt.+ 
 4  We have had our full share of* ridicule from the self-assuredAnd the contempt of the arrogant.
