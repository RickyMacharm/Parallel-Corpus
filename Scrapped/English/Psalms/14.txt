14  The foolish* one says in his heart: “There is no Jehovah.”+ Their actions are corrupt, and their dealings are detestable;No one is doing good.+ 
 2  But Jehovah looks down from heaven on the sons of menTo see whether anyone has insight, whether anyone is seeking Jehovah.+ 
 3  They have all turned aside;+They are all alike corrupt. No one is doing good,Not even one. 
 4  Do none of the wrongdoers understand? They devour my people as if they were eating bread. They do not call on Jehovah. 
 5  But they will be filled with great terror,+For Jehovah is with the generation of the righteous. 
 6  You wrongdoers try to frustrate the plans of the lowly one,But Jehovah is his refuge.+ 
 7  O that Israel’s salvation may come from Zion!+ When Jehovah gathers back his captive people,Let Jacob be joyful, let Israel rejoice.
