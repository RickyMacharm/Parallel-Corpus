110  Jehovah declared to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand+Until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.”+ 
 2  Jehovah will extend the scepter of your power out of Zion, saying: “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.”+ 
 3  Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.* In splendid holiness, from the womb of the dawn,You have your company of young men just like dewdrops. 
 4  Jehovah has sworn an oath, and he will not change his mind:* “You are a priest forever+In the manner of Mel·chizʹe·dek!”+ 
 5  Jehovah will be at your right hand;+He will crush kings on the day of his anger.+ 
 6  He will execute judgment against* the nations;+He will fill the land with dead bodies.+ He will crush the leader* of a vast land.* 
 7  He* will drink from the stream along the road. Therefore, he will hold his head high.
