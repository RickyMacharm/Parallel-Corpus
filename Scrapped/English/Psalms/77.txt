77  With my voice I will cry out to God;To God I will cry out, and he will hear me.+ 
 2  In the day of my distress I search for Jehovah.+ At night my hands are stretched out to him without ceasing.* I* cannot be comforted. 
 3  When I remember God, I groan;+I am troubled and my strength fails.*+ (Selah) 
 4  You hold my eyelids open;I am agitated and cannot speak. 
 5  My thoughts turn to the days of long ago,+The years of the distant past. 
 6  During the night I remember my song;*+I ponder in my heart;+I make* a diligent search. 
 7  Will Jehovah cast us off forever?+ Will he never again show his favor?+ 
 8  Has his loyal love ceased forever? Will his promise come to nothing for all generations? 
 9  Has God forgotten to show his favor,+Or has his anger caused his mercy to cease? (Selah) 
10  Must I keep saying: “This is what distresses me:*+ The Most High has changed his position* toward us”? 
11  I will remember the works of Jah;I will remember your marvelous deeds of long ago. 
12  And I will meditate on all your activityAnd ponder over your dealings.+ 
13  O God, your ways are holy. What god is as great as you, O God?+ 
14  You are the true God, who does marvelous things.+ You have revealed your strength to the peoples.+ 
15  With your power* you have rescued* your people,+The sons of Jacob and of Joseph. (Selah) 
16  The waters saw you, O God;The waters saw you and were disturbed.+ And the deep waters became agitated. 
17  The clouds poured down water. The cloudy skies thundered,And your arrows flew here and there.+ 
18  The sound of your thunder+ was like chariot wheels;Flashes of lightning lit up the inhabited earth;*+The earth trembled and quaked.+ 
19  Your way was through the sea,+Your path through many waters;But your footprints could not be traced. 
20  You led your people just like a flock,+In the care* of Moses and Aaron.+
