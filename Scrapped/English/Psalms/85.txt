85  You have shown favor, O Jehovah, to your land;+You brought back those of Jacob who were taken captive.+ 
 2  You have pardoned the error of your people;You forgave* all their sin.+ (Selah) 
 3  You held back all your fury;You turned away from your hot anger.+ 
 4  Restore us,* O God of our salvation,And set aside your displeasure with us.+ 
 5  Will you be furious with us forever?+ Will you prolong your anger to generation after generation? 
 6  Will you not revive us againSo that your people may rejoice in you?+ 
 7  Show your loyal love to us, O Jehovah,+And grant us your salvation. 
 8  I will listen to what the true God Jehovah says,For he will speak peace to his people,+ to his loyal ones,But let them not return to overconfidence.+ 
 9  Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him,+So that his glory may reside in our land. 
10  Loyal love and faithfulness will meet together;Righteousness and peace will kiss each other.+ 
11  Faithfulness will sprout from the earth,And righteousness will look down from the heavens.+ 
12  Yes, Jehovah will give what is good,*+And our land will yield its harvest.+ 
13  Righteousness will walk before him+And make a path for his footsteps.
