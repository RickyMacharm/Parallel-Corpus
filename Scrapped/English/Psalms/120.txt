120  I called to Jehovah in my distress,+And he answered me.+ 
 2  O Jehovah, rescue me* from lying lipsAnd from the deceitful tongue. 
 3  What will He do to you, and how will He punish you,*You deceitful tongue?+ 
 4  With sharp arrows+ of a warriorAnd burning coals+ of broomwood. 
 5  Woe to me, for I have lived as a foreigner in Meʹshech!+ I have been dwelling among the tents of Keʹdar.+ 
 6  I have* been dwelling far too longWith those who hate peace.+ 
 7  I am for peace, but when I speak,They are for war.
