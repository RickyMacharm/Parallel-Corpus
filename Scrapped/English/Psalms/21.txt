21  O Jehovah, in your strength the king rejoices;+How greatly he rejoices in your acts of salvation!+ 
 2  You have granted him the desire of his heart,+And you have not withheld the request of his lips. (Selah) 
 3  For you meet him with rich blessings;You place a crown of fine* gold on his head.+ 
 4  He asked you for life, and you gave it to him,+A long life,* forever and ever. 
 5  Your acts of salvation bring him great glory.+ Dignity and splendor you bestow on him. 
 6  You make him blessed forever;+You make him glad with the joy of your presence.*+ 
 7  For the king trusts in Jehovah;+Because of the loyal love of the Most High, he will never be shaken.*+ 
 8  Your hand will find all your enemies;Your right hand will find those hating you. 
 9  You will make them like a fiery furnace at the appointed time when you give them attention. Jehovah will swallow them up in his anger, and fire will consume them.+ 
10  Their descendants* you will destroy from the earth,And their offspring from the sons of men. 
11  For they intended to do what is bad against you;+They have devised schemes that will not succeed.+ 
12  For you will make them retreat+By aiming your bow* at them.* 
13  Rise up, O Jehovah, in your strength. We will sing praises* to your mightiness.
