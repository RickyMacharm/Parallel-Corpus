11  In Jehovah I have taken refuge.+ So how can you say to me:* “Flee like a bird to your mountain! 
 2  See how the wicked bend the bow;They set their arrow on the bowstring,To shoot from the darkness those upright in heart. 
 3  When the foundations* are torn down,What can the righteous do?” 
 4  Jehovah is in his holy temple.+ Jehovah’s throne is in the heavens.+ His own eyes see, his watchful* eyes examine the sons of men.+ 
 5  Jehovah examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one;+He* hates anyone who loves violence.+ 
 6  Upon the wicked, he will rain down snares;*Fire and sulfur+ and a scorching wind will be the portion of their cup. 
 7  For Jehovah is righteous;+ he loves righteous acts.+ The upright will see his face.*+
