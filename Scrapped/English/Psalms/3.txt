3  O Jehovah, why have my adversaries become so numerous?+ Why are so many rising up against me?+ 
 2  Many are saying about me:* “God will not save him.”+ (Selah)* 
 3  But you, O Jehovah, are a shield around me,+My glory+ and the One who lifts up my head.+ 
 4  I will call aloud to Jehovah,And he will answer me from his holy mountain.+ (Selah) 
 5  I will lie down and sleep;And I will wake up in safety,For Jehovah continues to support me.+ 
 6  I am not afraid of the tens of thousandsLined up against me on every side.+ 
 7  Rise up, O Jehovah! Save me,+ O my God! For you will strike all my enemies on the jaw;You will break the teeth of the wicked.+ 
 8  Salvation belongs to Jehovah.+ Your blessing is upon your people. (Selah)
