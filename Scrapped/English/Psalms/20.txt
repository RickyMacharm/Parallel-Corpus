20  May Jehovah answer you in the day of distress. May the name of the God of Jacob protect you.+ 
 2  May he send you help from the holy place+And sustain you from Zion.+ 
 3  May he remember all your gift offerings;May he accept with favor* your burnt offering. (Selah) 
 4  May he grant you the desires of your heart+And give success to all your plans.* 
 5  We will shout joyfully over your acts of salvation;+We will lift our banners in the name of our God.+ May Jehovah fulfill all your requests. 
 6  Now I do know that Jehovah saves his anointed one.+ He answers him from his holy heavensWith great salvation* by his right hand.+ 
 7  Some rely on chariots and others on horses,+But we call on the name of Jehovah our God.+ 
 8  They have collapsed and fallen,But we have risen up and been restored.+ 
 9  O Jehovah, save the king!+ He will answer us in the day we call for help.+
