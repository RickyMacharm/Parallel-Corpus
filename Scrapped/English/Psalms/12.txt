12  Save me, O Jehovah, for the loyal one is no more;Faithful people have vanished from among men. 
 2  They speak lies to one another;They flatter with their lips* and speak with deceitful hearts.*+ 
 3  Jehovah will cut off all flattering lipsAnd the tongue that makes great boasts,+
 4  Those who say: “We will prevail with our tongues. We use our lips as we please;Who will be our master?”+ 
 5  “Because the afflicted are oppressed,Because of the sighing of the poor,+I will rise up to act,” says Jehovah. “I will save them from those who treat them with contempt.”* 
 6  The sayings of Jehovah are pure;+They are like silver refined in an earthen furnace,* purified seven times. 
 7  You will guard them, O Jehovah;+You will protect each one of them from this generation forever. 
 8  The wicked walk around unrestrainedBecause the sons of men promote depravity.+
