6  O Jehovah, do not reprove me in your anger,And do not correct me in your rage.+ 
 2  Show me favor,* O Jehovah, for I am growing weak. Heal me, O Jehovah,+ for my bones are shaking. 
 3  Yes, I am* greatly disturbed,+And I ask you, O Jehovahâ€”how long will it be?+ 
 4  Return, O Jehovah, and rescue me;*+Save me for the sake of your loyal love.+ 
 5  For in death there is no mention* of you;In the Grave,* who will praise you?+ 
 6  I have grown weary with my sighing;+All night long I soak my bed with tears;*I flood my couch with weeping.+ 
 7  My eye is weak from my grief;+It has dimmed* because of all those harassing me. 
 8  Get away from me, all you who behave wickedly,For Jehovah will hear the sound of my weeping.+ 
 9  Jehovah will hear my request for favor;+Jehovah will accept my prayer. 
10  All my enemies will be put to shame and dismayed;They will fall back in sudden disgrace.+
