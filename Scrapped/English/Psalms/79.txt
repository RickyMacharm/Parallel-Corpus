79  O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance;+They have defiled your holy temple;+They have turned Jerusalem into a heap of ruins.+ 
 2  They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the heavensAnd the flesh of your loyal ones to the wild beasts of the earth.+ 
 3  They have poured out their blood like water around Jerusalem,And no one is left to bury them.+ 
 4  We have become an object of reproach to our neighbors;+Those around us ridicule and jeer us. 
 5  How long, O Jehovah, will you be furious? Forever?+ How long will your indignation burn just like fire?+ 
 6  Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know youAnd on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.+ 
 7  For they have devoured JacobAnd have desolated his homeland.+ 
 8  Do not hold us accountable for the errors of our ancestors.+ Quickly show us your mercy,+For we have been brought very low. 
 9  Help us, O God of our salvation,+For the sake of your glorious name;Rescue us and forgive* our sins for the sake of your name.+ 
10  Why should the nations say: “Where is their God?”+ Before our eyes may it become known among the nationsThat the shed blood of your servants has been avenged.+ 
11  May you hear the sighing of the prisoner.+ Use your great power* to preserve* those sentenced to death.*+ 
12  Repay our neighbors sevenfold+For the taunts they have leveled at you, O Jehovah.+ 
13  Then we, your people and the flock of your pasture,+Will give thanks to you forever;And we will declare your praise from generation to generation.+
