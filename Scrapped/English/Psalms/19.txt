19  The heavens are declaring the glory of God;+The skies above* proclaim the work of his hands.+ 
 2  Day after day their speech bubbles forth,And night after night they reveal knowledge. 
 3  There is no speech, and there are no words;Their voice is not heard. 
 4  But into all the earth their sound* has gone out,And to the ends of the inhabited earth* their message.+ In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun;
 5  It is like a bridegroom emerging from the bridal chamber;It rejoices like a mighty man running his course. 
 6  It emerges from one end of the heavens,And it circles to their other end;+And nothing is concealed from its heat. 
 7  The law of Jehovah is perfect,+ restoring strength.*+ The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,+ making the inexperienced one wise.+ 
 8  The orders from Jehovah are righteous, causing the heart to rejoice;+The commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine.+ 
 9  The fear of Jehovah+ is pure, lasting forever. The judgments of Jehovah are true, altogether righteous.+ 
10  They are more desirable than gold,Than much fine* gold,+And sweeter than honey,+ the honey that drips from the combs. 
11  By them your servant has been warned;+In keeping them, there is a large reward.+ 
12  Who can discern mistakes?+ Pronounce me innocent from sins I am unaware of. 
13  And hold your servant back from presumptuous acts;+Do not let them dominate me.+ Then I will be complete,+And innocent of blatant sins.* 
14  May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heartBe pleasing to you,+ O Jehovah, my Rock+ and my Redeemer.+
