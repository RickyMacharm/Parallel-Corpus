53  The foolish* one says in his heart: “There is no Jehovah.”+ Their unrighteous actions are corrupt and detestable;No one is doing good.+ 
 2  But God looks down from heaven on the sons of men+To see whether anyone has insight, whether anyone is seeking Jehovah.+ 
 3  They have all turned away;They are all alike corrupt. No one is doing good,Not even one.+ 
 4  Do none of the wrongdoers understand? They devour my people as if they were eating bread. They do not call on Jehovah.+ 
 5  But they will be filled with great terror,Terror they have never felt before,*For God will scatter the bones of those attacking you.* You will put them to shame, for Jehovah has rejected them. 
 6  O that Israel’s salvation may come from Zion!+ When Jehovah gathers back his captive people,Let Jacob be joyful, let Israel rejoice.
