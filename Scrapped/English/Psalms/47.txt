47  All you peoples, clap your hands. Shout in triumph to God with joyful cries. 
 2  For Jehovah the Most High is awe-inspiring;+He is the great King over all the earth.+ 
 3  He subdues peoples under us;He puts nations under our feet.+ 
 4  He chooses our inheritance for us,+The pride of Jacob, whom he loves.+ (Selah) 
 5  God has ascended amid joyful shouting;Jehovah, amid the sound of the horn.* 
 6  Sing praises* to God, sing praises. Sing praises to our King, sing praises. 
 7  For God is King of all the earth;+Sing praises, and show insight. 
 8  God has become King over the nations.+ God sits on his holy throne. 
 9  The leaders of the peoples have gathered togetherWith the people of the God of Abraham. For the rulers* of the earth belong to God. He is highly exalted.+
