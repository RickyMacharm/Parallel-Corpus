125  Those who trust in Jehovah+Are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shakenBut endures forever.+ 
 2  Just as mountains surround Jerusalem,+So Jehovah surrounds his people+From now on and forever. 
 3  The scepter of wickedness will not remain upon the land allotted to the righteous,+So that the righteous do not turn to doing* what is wrong.+ 
 4  Do good, O Jehovah, to those who are good,+To those who are upright in heart.+ 
 5  As for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,Jehovah will remove them along with the wrongdoers.+ May there be peace upon Israel.
