129  “Since my youth they have constantly attacked me”+ —Let Israel now say—
 2  “Since my youth they have constantly attacked me;+But they have not defeated me.+ 
 3  Plowmen have plowed across my back;+They have made their furrows long.” 
 4  But Jehovah is righteous;+He has cut up the ropes of the wicked.+ 
 5  They will be put to shame and will retreat in disgrace,All those who hate Zion.+ 
 6  They will become like grass on the rooftopsThat withers before it is pulled up,
 7  That cannot fill the reaper’s handNor the arms of the one gathering sheaves. 
 8  Those passing by will not say: “May the blessing of Jehovah be upon you;We bless you in the name of Jehovah.”
