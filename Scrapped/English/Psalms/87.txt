 2  Jehovah loves the gates of Zion+More than all the tents of Jacob. 
 3  Glorious things are being said about you, O city of the true God.+ (Selah) 
 4  I will count Raʹhab+ and Babylon among those who know* me;Here are Phi·lisʹti·a and Tyre, together with Cush. It will be said: “This is one who was born there.” 
 5  And about Zion it will be said: “Each and every one was born in her.” And the Most High will firmly establish her. 
 6  Jehovah will declare, when recording the peoples: “This is one who was born there.” (Selah) 
 7  Singers+ and those performing circle dances+ will say: “All my springs are in you.”*+
