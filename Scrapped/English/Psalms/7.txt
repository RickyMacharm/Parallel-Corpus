7  O Jehovah my God, in you I have taken refuge.+ Save me from all those persecuting me and rescue me.+ 
 2  Otherwise they will tear me* to pieces as a lion does,+Carrying me off with no one to rescue me. 
 3  O Jehovah my God, if I am at fault in this,If I have acted unjustly,
 4  If I have wronged the one doing good to me,+Or if I have plundered my enemy without cause,*
 5  Then let an enemy pursue and overtake me;*Let him trample my life down to the earthAnd cause my glory to perish in the dust. (Selah) 
 6  Rise up in your anger, O Jehovah;Stand up against the fury of my enemies;+Awake for me, and demand that justice be done.+ 
 7  Let the nations surround you;And you will act against them from on high. 
 8  Jehovah will pass sentence on the peoples.+ Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousnessAnd according to my integrity.+ 
 9  Please put an end to the evil deeds of the wicked. But establish the righteous,+Since you are the righteous God+ who examines the hearts+ and the deepest emotions.*+ 
10  God is my shield,+ the Savior of those upright in heart.+ 
11  God is a righteous Judge,+And God proclaims his judgments* every day. 
12  If anyone will not repent,+ He sharpens his sword;+He bends his bow and makes it ready.+ 
13  He prepares his deadly weapons;He makes ready his flaming arrows.+ 
14  Look at the one who is pregnant with wickedness;He conceives trouble and gives birth to lies.+ 
15  He excavates a pit and digs it deep,But he falls into the very hole he made.+ 
16  The trouble he causes will return on his own head;+His violence will fall on the crown of his head. 
17  I will praise Jehovah for his justice;+I will sing praises* to the name of Jehovah+ the Most High.+
