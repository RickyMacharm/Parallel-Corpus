49  Hear this, all you peoples. Pay attention, all you inhabitants of the world,*
 2  Both small and great,*Rich and poor alike. 
 3  My own mouth will speak wisdom,And the meditation of my heart+ will show understanding. 
 4  I will pay attention to a proverb;I will expound my riddle with the harp. 
 5  Why should I fear during times of trouble,+When I am surrounded by the evil* of those trying to overthrow me? 
 6  Those who are trusting in their wealth+And who boast about their great riches,+
 7  None of them can ever redeem a brotherOr give to God a ransom for him,+
 8  (The ransom* price for their life* is so preciousThat it is always beyond their reach);
 9  That he should live forever and not see the pit.*+ 
10  He sees that even wise people die;The stupid and the unreasoning perish together,+And they must leave their wealth to others.+ 
11  Their inner wish is that their houses will last forever,Their tents to generation after generation. They have named their estates after themselves. 
12  But man, although honored, will not remain;+He is no better than the beasts that perish.+ 
13  This is the way of the stupid ones+And of those who follow them, who take pleasure in their empty words. (Selah) 
14  They are assigned like sheep to the Grave.* Death will shepherd them;The upright will rule over them+ in the morning. Every trace of them will fade away;+The Grave*+ rather than a palace will be their home.+ 
15  But God will redeem me* from the power* of the Grave,*+For he will take hold of me. (Selah) 
16  Do not be afraid because a man becomes rich,Because the splendor of his house increases,
17  For when he dies he can take nothing with him;+His splendor will not go down with him.+ 
18  For during his lifetime he congratulates himself.*+ (People praise you when you prosper.)+ 
19  But he finally joins the generation of his forefathers. They will never again see the light. 
20  A man who does not understand this, although honored,+Is no better than the beasts that perish.
