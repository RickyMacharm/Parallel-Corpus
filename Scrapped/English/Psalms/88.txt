88  O Jehovah, the God of my salvation,+By day I cry out,And by night I come before you.+ 
 2  Let my prayer come to you,+Incline your ear* to my cry for help.+ 
 3  For my soul* has been filled with calamity,+And my life is on the brink of the Grave.*+ 
 4  I am already counted among those going down to the pit;*+I have become a helpless man,*+
 5  Left among the deadLike the slain lying in a grave,Whom you remember no longerAnd who have been separated from your care.* 
 6  You have put me in the lowest pit,In dark places, in a large abyss. 
 7  Your rage weighs heavily on me,+And you overwhelm me with your crashing waves. (Selah) 
 8  You have driven my acquaintances far away from me;+You have made me something detestable to them. I am trapped and cannot escape. 
 9  My eye is worn out because of my affliction.+ I call on you, O Jehovah, all day long;+To you I spread out my hands. 
10  Will you perform wonders for the dead? Can those powerless in death rise up to praise you?+ (Selah) 
11  Will your loyal love be declared in the grave,Your faithfulness in the place of destruction?* 
12  Will your wonders be known in the darknessOr your righteousness in the land of oblivion?+ 
13  But I still cry to you for help, O Jehovah,+Each morning my prayer comes before you.+ 
14  Why, O Jehovah, do you reject me?*+ Why do you hide your face from me?+ 
15  From my youth on,I have been afflicted and ready to perish;+I am numb from the terrible things you allow me to suffer. 
16  Your burning anger overwhelms me;+Your terrors destroy me. 
17  They surround me like waters all day long;They close in on me from all sides.* 
18  You have driven my friends and companions far away from me;+Darkness has become my companion.
