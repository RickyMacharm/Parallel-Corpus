42  As a deer that longs for streams of water,So I long* for you, O God. 
 2  I do thirst* for God, for the living God.+ When may I come and appear before God?+ 
 3  My tears are my food day and night;All day long people taunt me: “Where is your God?”+ 
 4  These things I remember, and I pour out my soul,*For I once walked along with the multitude;I used to walk solemnly* before them to the house of God,With sounds of rejoicing and thanksgiving,Those of a crowd celebrating a festival.+ 
 5  Why am I* in despair?+ Why is this turmoil within me? Wait for God,+For I will yet praise him as my Grand Savior.+ 
 6  My God, I am* in despair.+ That is why I remember you,+From the land of Jordan and the peaks of Herʹmon,From Mount Mi·zarʹ.* 
 7  Deep waters call to deep watersAt the sound of your waterfalls. All your surging waves have overwhelmed me.+ 
 8  By day Jehovah will grant me his loyal love,And by night his song will be with me—a prayer to the God of my life.+ 
 9  I will say to God, my crag: “Why have you forgotten me?+ Why should I walk about sad because of the oppression by my enemy?”+ 
10  With murderous hostility* my enemies taunt me;All day long they taunt me: “Where is your God?”+ 
11  Why am I* in despair? Why is this turmoil within me? Wait for God,+For I will yet praise him as my Grand Savior and my God.+
