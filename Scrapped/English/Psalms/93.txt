93  Jehovah has become King!+ With grandeur he is clothed;Jehovah is clothed with strength;He wears it like a belt. The earth* is firmly established;It cannot be moved.* 
 2  Your throne was firmly established long ago;+From eternity you have existed.+ 
 3  The rivers have surged, O Jehovah,The rivers have surged and roared;The rivers keep surging and pounding. 
 4  Above the sound of many waters,Mightier than the breaking waves of the sea,+Jehovah is majestic in the heights.+ 
 5  Your reminders are very trustworthy.+ Holiness adorns* your house,+ O Jehovah, for all times.
