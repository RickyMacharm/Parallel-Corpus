4  When I call, answer me, O my righteous God.+ Make a way of escape* for me in my distress. Show me favor and hear my prayer. 
 2  You sons of men, how long will you turn my honor into humiliation? How long will you love what is worthless and search for what is false? (Selah) 
 3  Know that Jehovah will treat his loyal one in a special way;*Jehovah will hear when I call to him. 
 4  Be agitated, but do not sin.+ Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent. (Selah) 
 5  Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,And trust in Jehovah.+ 
 6  There are many saying: “Who will show us anything good?” Let the light of your face shine upon us, O Jehovah.+ 
 7  You have filled my heart with greater rejoicingThan those who have an abundant harvest of grain and new wine. 
 8  I will lie down and sleep in peace,+For you alone, O Jehovah, make me dwell in security.+
