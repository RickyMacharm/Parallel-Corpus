43  Judge me, O God,+Defend my legal case+ against a disloyal nation. Rescue me from the man of deception and unrighteousness. 
 2  For you are my God, my fortress.+ Why have you cast me off? Why must I walk about sad because of the oppression by my enemy?+ 
 3  Send out your light and your truth.+ May these lead me;+May they guide me to your holy mountain and to your grand tabernacle.+ 
 4  Then I will come to the altar of God,+To God, my exceeding joy. And I will praise you with the harp,+ O God, my God. 
 5  Why am I* in despair? Why is this turmoil within me? Wait for God,+For I will yet praise him as my Grand Savior and my God.+
