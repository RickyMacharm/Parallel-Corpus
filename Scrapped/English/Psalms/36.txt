36  Transgression speaks to the wicked one deep within his heart;There is no fear of God before his eyes.+ 
 2  For in his own eyes he flatters himself too muchTo detect and hate his error.+ 
 3  The words of his mouth are hurtful and deceptive;He shows no insight for doing what is good. 
 4  He plots hurtful schemes even on his bed. He is set on a path that is not good;He does not reject what is bad. 
 5  O Jehovah, your loyal love reaches to the heavens,+Your faithfulness up to the clouds. 
 6  Your righteousness is like majestic mountains;*+Your judgments are like vast, deep waters.+ Man and beast you preserve,* O Jehovah.+ 
 7  How precious your loyal love is, O God!+ In the shadow of your wings,The sons of men take refuge.+ 
 8  They drink their fill of the rich bounty* of your house,+And you cause them to drink of the torrent of your delights.+ 
 9  With you is the source of life;+By your light we can see light.+ 
10  Continue showing your loyal love to those who know you,+And your righteousness, to the upright in heart.+ 
11  Do not let the foot of the haughty tread on meOr the hand of the wicked drive me away. 
12  There the wrongdoers have fallen;They have been knocked down and cannot get up.+
