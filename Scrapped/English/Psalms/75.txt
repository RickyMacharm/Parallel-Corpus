75  We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks to you;Your name is near,+And people declare your wondrous works. 
 2  You say: “When I set a time,I judge with fairness. 
 3  When the earth and all its inhabitants were dissolved,It was I who kept its pillars firm.” (Selah) 
 4  I say to the boastful, “Do not boast,” And to the wicked, “Do not exalt your strength.* 
 5  Do not exalt your strength* up highOr speak with arrogance. 
 6  For exaltation does not comeFrom the east or the west or the south. 
 7  For God is Judge.+ He puts one man down and exalts another.+ 
 8  For there is a cup in Jehovah’s hand;+The wine is foaming and is fully mixed. He will surely pour it out,And all the wicked of the earth will drink it, down to the dregs.”+ 
 9  But as for me, I will proclaim it forever;I will sing praises* to the God of Jacob. 
10  For he says: “I will cut off all the strength* of the wicked,But the strength* of the righteous will be exalted.”
