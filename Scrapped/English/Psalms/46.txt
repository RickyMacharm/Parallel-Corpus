46  God is our refuge and strength,+A help that is readily found in times of distress.+ 
 2  That is why we will not fear, though the earth undergoes change,Though the mountains topple into the depths of the sea,+
 3  Though its waters roar and foam over,+Though the mountains rock on account of its turbulence. (Selah) 
 4  There is a river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice,+The holy grand tabernacle of the Most High. 
 5  God is in the city;+ it cannot be overthrown. God will come to its aid at the break of dawn.+ 
 6  The nations were in an uproar, the kingdoms were overthrown;He raised his voice, and the earth melted.+ 
 7  Jehovah of armies is with us;+The God of Jacob is our secure refuge.* (Selah) 
 8  Come and witness the activities of Jehovah,How he has done astonishing things on the earth. 
 9  He is bringing an end to wars throughout the earth.+ He breaks the bow and shatters the spear;He burns the military wagons* with fire. 
10  “Give in and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations;+I will be exalted in the earth.”+ 
11  Jehovah of armies is with us;+The God of Jacob is a secure refuge for us.+ (Selah)
