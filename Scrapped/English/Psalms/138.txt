138  I will praise you with all my heart.+ In the face of other gods,I will sing praises.* 
 2  I will bow down toward your holy temple,*+And I will praise your name+Because of your loyal love and your faithfulness. For you have magnified your saying and your name above everything else.* 
 3  On the day I called, you answered me;+You made me bold* and strong.+ 
 4  All the kings of the earth will praise you, O Jehovah,+For they will have heard the promises you have spoken. 
 5  They will sing about the ways of Jehovah,For the glory of Jehovah is great.+ 
 6  Though Jehovah is high, he takes note of the humble,+But the haughty he knows only from a distance.+ 
 7  Even when I walk in the midst of danger, you will preserve me alive.+ You stretch out your hand against the anger of my enemies;Your right hand will save me. 
 8  Jehovah will accomplish all things in my behalf. O Jehovah, your loyal love endures forever;+Do not forsake the works of your hands.+
