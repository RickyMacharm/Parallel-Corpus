150  Praise Jah!*+ Praise God in his holy place.+ Praise him in the expanse of* his strength.+ 
 2  Praise him for his mighty works.+ Praise him for his exceeding greatness.+ 
 3  Praise him with the sounding of the horn.+ Praise him with the stringed instrument and the harp.+ 
 4  Praise him with the tambourine+ and the circle dance. Praise him with strings+ and the flute.*+ 
 5  Praise him with ringing cymbals. Praise him with crashing cymbals.+ 
 6  Every breathing thingâ€”let it praise Jah. Praise Jah!*+
