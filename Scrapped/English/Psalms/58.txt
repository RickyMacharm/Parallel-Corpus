58  Can you speak about righteousness when you are silent?+ Can you judge in uprightness, you sons of men?+ 
 2  Instead, you devise unrighteousness in your heart,+And your hands dispense violence in the land.+ 
 3  The wicked go astray* from birth;*They are wayward, liars from the time they are born. 
 4  Their venom is like the venom of serpents;+They are deaf like the cobra that stops up its ear. 
 5  It will not listen to the voice of charmers,No matter how skillful their spells. 
 6  O God, knock the teeth out of their mouth! Break the jaws of these lions,* O Jehovah! 
 7  May they disappear like waters that drain away. May He bend his bow and make them fall by his arrows. 
 8  May they be like a snail that melts away as it moves along;Like a woman’s stillborn child who never sees the sun. 
 9  Before your cooking pots feel the heat of the bramble,He will sweep away both the moist and the burning twig, as in a storm wind.+ 
10  The righteous one will rejoice because he has seen the vengeance;+His feet will be drenched with the blood of the wicked.+ 
11  Then men will say: “Surely there is a reward for the righteous.+ There is indeed a God who judges in the earth.”+
