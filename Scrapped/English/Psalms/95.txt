95  Come, let us shout joyfully to Jehovah! Let us shout in triumph to our Rock of salvation.+ 
 2  Let us come into his presence* with thanksgiving;+Let us sing and shout in triumph to him. 
 3  For Jehovah is a great God,A great King over all other gods.+ 
 4  In his hand are the depths of the earth;The mountain peaks belong to him.+ 
 5  The sea, which he made, belongs to him,+And his hands formed the dry land.+ 
 6  Come, let us worship and bow down;Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker.+ 
 7  For he is our God,And we are the people of his pasture,The sheep in his care.*+ Today if you listen to his voice,+
 8  Do not harden your heart as at Merʹi·bah,*+As in the day of Masʹsah* in the wilderness,+
 9  When your forefathers tested me;+They challenged me, though they had seen my works.+ 
10  For 40 years I felt a loathing toward that generation, and I said: “They are a people who always go astray in their hearts;They have not come to know my ways.” 
11  So I swore in my anger: “They will not enter into my rest.”+
