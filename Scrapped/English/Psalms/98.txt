98  Sing to Jehovah a new song,+For he has done wonderful things.+ His right hand, his holy arm, has brought about salvation.*+ 
 2  Jehovah has made known his salvation;+He has revealed his righteousness before the nations.+ 
 3  He has remembered his loyal love and faithfulness to the house of Israel.+ All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation by our God.*+ 
 4  Shout in triumph to Jehovah, all the earth. Be cheerful and shout joyfully and sing praises.*+ 
 5  Sing praises* to Jehovah with the harp,With the harp and the melodious song. 
 6  With the trumpets and the sound of the horn,+Shout in triumph before the King, Jehovah. 
 7  Let the sea thunder and all that fills it,The earth* and those dwelling in it. 
 8  Let the rivers clap their hands;Let the mountains shout joyfully together+
 9  Before Jehovah, for he is coming* to judge the earth. He will judge the inhabited earth* with righteousness+And the peoples with fairness.+
