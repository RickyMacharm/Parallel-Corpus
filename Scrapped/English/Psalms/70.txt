70  O God, save me;O Jehovah, hurry to help me.+ 
 2  May those seeking to take my life*Be put to shame and disgraced. May those who delight in my calamityRetreat in humiliation. 
 3  May those who are saying: “Aha! Aha!” Be driven back in shame. 
 4  But let those who are seeking youExult and rejoice in you.+ May those who love your acts of salvation always say: “May God be magnified!” 
 5  But I am helpless and poor;+O God, act quickly in my behalf.+ You are my helper and my rescuer;+O Jehovah, do not delay.+
