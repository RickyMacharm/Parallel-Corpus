103  Let me* praise Jehovah;Let everything within me praise his holy name. 
 2  Let me* praise Jehovah;May I never forget all that he has done.+ 
 3  He forgives all your errors+And heals all your ailments;+
 4  He reclaims your life from the pit*+And crowns you with his loyal love and mercy.+ 
 5  He satisfies you with good things+ all your life,So that your youth is renewed like that of an eagle.+ 
 6  Jehovah acts with righteousness+ and justiceFor all who are oppressed.+ 
 7  He made known his ways to Moses,+His deeds to the sons of Israel.+ 
 8  Jehovah is merciful and compassionate,*+Slow to anger and abundant in loyal love.*+ 
 9  He will not always find fault,+Nor will he stay resentful forever.+ 
10  He has not dealt with us according to our sins,+Nor has he repaid us what our errors deserve.+ 
11  For as the heavens are higher than the earth,So great is his loyal love toward those who fear him.+ 
12  As far off as the sunrise is from the sunset,So far off from us he has put our transgressions.+ 
13  As a father shows mercy to his sons,Jehovah has shown mercy to those who fear him.+ 
14  For he well knows how we are formed,+Remembering that we are dust.+ 
15  As for mortal man, his days are like those of grass;+He blooms like a blossom of the field.+ 
16  But when a wind blows, it is no more,As though it was never there.* 
17  But the loyal love of Jehovah is for all eternity*Toward those who fear him,+And his righteousness toward their childrenâ€™s children,+
18  Toward those who keep his covenant+And those who are careful to observe his orders. 
19  Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens;+And his kingship rules over everything.+ 
20  Praise Jehovah, all you his angels,+ mighty in power,Who carry out his word,+ obeying his voice.* 
21  Praise Jehovah, all his armies,+His ministers who do his will.+ 
22  Praise Jehovah, all his works,In all the places where he rules.* Let my whole being* praise Jehovah.
