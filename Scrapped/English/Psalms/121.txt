121  I raise my eyes to the mountains.+ From where will my help come? 
 2  My help comes from Jehovah,+The Maker of heaven and earth. 
 3  He will never allow your foot to slip.*+ The One guarding you will never be drowsy. 
 4  Look! He will never be drowsy nor go to sleep,The One guarding Israel.+ 
 5  Jehovah is guarding you. Jehovah is the shade+ at your right hand.+ 
 6  By day the sun will not strike you,+Nor the moon by night.+ 
 7  Jehovah will guard you against all harm.+ He will guard your life.*+ 
 8  Jehovah will guard you in all you do*From now on and forever.
