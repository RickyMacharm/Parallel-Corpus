34  I will praise Jehovah at all times;His praise will be on my lips constantly. 
 2  I* will boast in Jehovah;+The meek will hear and rejoice. 
 3  Magnify Jehovah along with me;+Let us exalt his name together. 
 4  I inquired of Jehovah, and he answered me.+ He rescued me from all my fears.+ 
 5  Those who looked to him became radiant;Their faces could not be put to shame. 
 6  This lowly one called, and Jehovah heard. He saved him from all his distresses.+ 
 7  The angel of Jehovah camps all around those fearing Him,+And he rescues them.+ 
 8  Taste and see that Jehovah is good;+Happy is the man who takes refuge in him. 
 9  Fear Jehovah, all you his holy ones,For those who fear him lack nothing.+ 
10  Even strong young lions* have been reduced to hunger,But those seeking Jehovah will lack nothing good.+ 
11  Come, my sons, listen to me;I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.+ 
12  Who among you takes pleasure in lifeAnd would love to see many good days?+ 
13  Then guard your tongue from what is bad,+Your lips from speaking deception.+ 
14  Turn away from what is bad and do what is good;+Seek peace and pursue it.+ 
15  The eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous,+And his ears listen to their cry for help.+ 
16  But the face of Jehovah is against those doing what is bad,To erase all memory of them from the earth.+ 
17  They cried out, and Jehovah heard;+He rescued them from all their distresses.+ 
18  Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted;+He saves those who are crushed in spirit.*+ 
19  Many are the hardships* of the righteous one,+But Jehovah rescues him from them all.+ 
20  He is guarding all his bones;Not one of them has been broken.+ 
21  Disaster will put the wicked to death;Those hating the righteous will be found guilty. 
22  Jehovah is redeeming the life* of his servants;None of those taking refuge in him will be found guilty.+
