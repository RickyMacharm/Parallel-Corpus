146  Praise Jah!*+ Let my whole being* praise Jehovah.+ 
 2  I will praise Jehovah all my life. I will sing praises* to my God as long as I live. 
 3  Do not put your trust in princes*Nor in a son of man, who cannot bring salvation.+ 
 4  His spirit* goes out, he returns to the ground;+On that very day his thoughts perish.+ 
 5  Happy is the one who has the God of Jacob as his helper,+Whose hope is in Jehovah his God,+
 6  The Maker of heaven and earth,Of the sea, and of all that is in them,+The One who always remains faithful,+
 7  The One securing justice for those defrauded,The One giving bread to the hungry.+ Jehovah is releasing the prisoners.*+ 
 8  Jehovah is opening the eyes of the blind;+Jehovah is raising up those bowed down;+Jehovah loves the righteous. 
 9  Jehovah is protecting the foreign residents;He sustains the fatherless child and the widow,+But he thwarts the plans of the wicked.*+ 
10  Jehovah will be King forever,+Your God, O Zion, for generation after generation. Praise Jah!*
