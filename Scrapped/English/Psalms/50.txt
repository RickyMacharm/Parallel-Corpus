50  The God of gods, Jehovah,*+ has spoken;He summons the earthFrom the rising of the sun until its setting.* 
 2  Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,+ God shines forth. 
 3  Our God will come and cannot remain silent.+ Before him is a consuming fire,+And a great storm rages all around him.+ 
 4  He summons the heavens above and the earth,+So as to judge his people:+ 
 5  “Gather to me my loyal ones,Those making a covenant with me over sacrifice.”+ 
 6  The heavens proclaim his righteousness,For God himself is Judge.+ (Selah) 
 7  “Listen, O my people, and I will speak;Israel, I will bear witness against you.+ I am God, your God.+ 
 8  I do not reprove you because of your sacrifices,Nor because of your whole burnt offerings that are constantly before me.+ 
 9  I do not need to take a bull from your house,Nor goats* from your pens.+ 
10  For every wild animal of the forest is mine,+Even the beasts upon a thousand mountains. 
11  I know every bird of the mountains;+The countless animals of the field are mine. 
12  If I were hungry, I would not tell you,For the productive land and everything in it is mine.+ 
13  Will I eat the flesh of bullsAnd drink the blood of goats?+ 
14  Offer thanksgiving as your sacrifice to God,+And pay your vows to the Most High;+
15  Call on me in the time of distress.+ I will rescue you, and you will glorify me.”+ 
16  But God will say to the wicked: “What right do you have to relate my regulations+Or to speak about my covenant?+ 
17  For you hate discipline,*And you keep turning your back on my words.*+ 
18  When you see a thief, you approve of him,*+And you keep company with adulterers. 
19  You use your mouth to spread what is bad,And deception is attached to your tongue.+ 
20  You sit and speak against your own brother;+You reveal the faults of* your own mother’s son. 
21  When you did these things, I remained silent,So you thought that I would be just like you. But now I will reprove you,And I will state my case against you.+ 
22  Please consider this, you who forget God,+So that I may not tear you to pieces with no one to rescue you. 
23  The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me,+And as for the one who follows a set course,I will cause him to see salvation by God.”+
