8  O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is throughout the earth;You have set your splendor even higher than the heavens!*+ 
 2  Out of the mouth of children and infants+ you have established strengthOn account of your adversaries,To silence the enemy and the avenger. 
 3  When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers,The moon and the stars that you have prepared,+
 4  What is mortal man that you keep him in mind,And a son of man that you take care of him?+ 
 5  You made him a little lower than godlike ones,*And you crowned him with glory and splendor. 
 6  You gave him dominion over the works of your hands;+You have put everything under his feet: 
 7  All the flocks and cattle,As well as the wild animals,*+
 8  The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea,Whatever passes through the paths of the seas. 
 9  O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is throughout the earth!
