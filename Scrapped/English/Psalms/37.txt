37  Do not be upset* because of evil menOr envious of wrongdoers.+ 
 2  They will quickly wither like grass+And shrivel like green new grass. 
 3  Trust in Jehovah and do what is good;+Reside in the earth,* and act with faithfulness.+ 
 4  Find exquisite delight* in Jehovah,And he will grant you the desires of your heart. 
 5  Commit your way to* Jehovah;+Rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.+ 
 6  He will make your righteousness shine like daybreak,And your justice like the midday sun. 
 7  Keep silent before Jehovah+And wait expectantly* for him. Do not be upset by the manWho succeeds in carrying out his schemes.+ 
 8  Let go of anger and abandon rage;+Do not become upset and turn to doing evil.* 
 9  For evil men will be done away with,+But those hoping in Jehovah will possess the earth.+ 
10  Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more;+You will look at where they were,And they will not be there.+ 
11  But the meek will possess the earth,+And they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.+ 
12  The wicked man plots against the righteous;+He grinds his teeth at him. 
13  But Jehovah will laugh at him,For He knows that his day will come.+ 
14  The wicked draw their swords and bend* their bowsTo bring down the oppressed and the poor,To slaughter those whose way is upright. 
15  But their sword will pierce their own heart;+Their bows will be broken. 
16  Better is the little of the righteous oneThan the abundance of many wicked ones.+ 
17  For the arms of the wicked will be broken,But Jehovah will support the righteous. 
18  Jehovah is aware of what the blameless go through,*And their inheritance will last forever.+ 
19  They will not be put to shame in the time of disaster;In the time of famine they will have plenty. 
20  But the wicked will perish;+The enemies of Jehovah will vanish like glorious pastures;They will vanish like smoke. 
21  The wicked one borrows and does not repay,But the righteous one is generous* and giving.+ 
22  Those blessed by Him will possess the earth,But those cursed by Him will be done away with.+ 
23  Jehovah guides* the steps of a man+When He finds pleasure in his way.+ 
24  Although he may fall, he will not be hurled down,+For Jehovah supports him by the hand.*+ 
25  I was once young and now I am old,But I have not seen anyone righteous abandoned,+Nor his children looking for bread.*+ 
26  He always lends freely,+And his children are in line for a blessing. 
27  Turn away from bad and do what is good,+And you will remain forever. 
28  For Jehovah loves justice,And he will not abandon his loyal ones.+ ×¢ [Ayin] They will always be guarded;+But the descendants of the wicked will be done away with.+ 
29  The righteous will possess the earth,+And they will live forever on it.+ 
30  The mouth of the righteous one imparts wisdom,*And his tongue speaks about justice.+ 
31  The law of his God is in his heart;+His steps will not falter.+ 
32  The wicked watches the righteous,Seeking to put him to death. 
33  But Jehovah will not abandon him to the hand of that one+Or find him guilty when he is judged.+ 
34  Hope in Jehovah and follow his way,And he will exalt you to take possession of the earth. When the wicked are done away with,+ you will see it.+ 
35  I have seen the ruthless, evil manSpreading out like a luxuriant tree in its native soil.+ 
36  But he suddenly passed away and was gone;+I kept searching for him, and he could not be found.+ 
37  Take note of the blameless one,*And keep the upright one+ in sight,For the future of that man will be peaceful.+ 
38  But all the transgressors will be destroyed;The future of wicked people will be cut off.+ 
39  The salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah;+He is their fortress in the time of distress.+ 
40  Jehovah will help them and rescue them.+ He will rescue them from the wicked and save them,Because they take refuge in him.+
