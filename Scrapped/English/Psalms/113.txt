113  Praise Jah!* Offer praise, you servants of Jehovah,Praise the name of Jehovah. 
 2  May Jehovah’s name be praisedFrom now on and forever.+ 
 3  From the rising of the sun to its setting,Let Jehovah’s name be praised.+ 
 4  Jehovah is high above all the nations;+His glory is above the heavens.+ 
 5  Who is like Jehovah our God,+The one who dwells* on high? 
 6  He stoops down to look on heaven and earth,+
 7  Raising the lowly from the dust. He lifts up the poor from the ash heap*+
 8  In order to make him sit with nobles,With the nobles of his people. 
 9  He gives the barren woman a homeAs a happy mother with children.*+ Praise Jah!*
