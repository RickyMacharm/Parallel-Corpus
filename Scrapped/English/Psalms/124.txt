124  “If Jehovah had not been with us”+ —Let Israel now say—
 2  “If Jehovah had not been with us+When men rose up to attack us,+
 3  Then they would have swallowed us up alive+When their anger was burning against us.+ 
 4  Then the waters would have washed us away,The torrent would have swept over us.*+ 
 5  The raging waters would have overwhelmed us.* 
 6  May Jehovah be praised,For he has not given us as prey to their teeth. 
 7  We are* like a bird that escapedFrom the hunter’s trap;+The trap was broken,And we escaped.+ 
 8  Our help is in the name of Jehovah,+The Maker of heaven and earth.”
