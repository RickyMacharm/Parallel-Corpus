130  From the depths I call to you, O Jehovah.+ 
 2  O Jehovah, hear my voice. May your ears pay attention to my pleas for help. 
 3  If errors were what you watch,* O Jah,*Then who, O Jehovah, could stand?+ 
 4  For with you there is true forgiveness,+So that you may be held in awe.*+ 
 5  I hope in Jehovah, my whole being* hopes in him;I wait for his word. 
 6  I eagerly wait* for Jehovah,+More than watchmen wait for the morning,+Yes, more than watchmen wait for the morning. 
 7  Let Israel keep waiting for Jehovah,For Jehovah is loyal in his love,+And he has great power to redeem. 
 8  He will redeem Israel from all their errors.
