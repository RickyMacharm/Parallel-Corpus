48  Jehovah is great and most worthy of praiseIn the city of our God, in his holy mountain. 
 2  Beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth,+Is Mount Zion in the far north,The city of the Grand King.+ 
 3  In her fortified towers,God has made known that he is a secure refuge.*+ 
 4  For look! kings have assembled;*Together they have advanced. 
 5  When they saw it, they were amazed. They panicked and fled in terror. 
 6  Trembling seized them there,Anguish like that of a woman giving birth. 
 7  With an east wind you wreck the ships of Tar πshish. 
 8  What we heard about, we have now seen for ourselvesIn the city of Jehovah of armies, in the city of our God. God will firmly establish it forever.+ (Selah) 
 9  We ponder your loyal love, O God,+Within your temple. 
10  Like your name, O God, your praiseReaches to the ends of the earth.+ Your right hand is filled with righteousness.+ 
11  May Mount Zion+ rejoice,May the towns* of Judah be joyful, because of your judgments.+ 
12  March around Zion; go all around it;Count its towers.+ 
13  Set your hearts upon its ramparts.*+ Inspect its fortified towers,So that you may tell about it to future generations. 
14  For this God is our God+ forever and ever. He will guide us forevermore.*+
