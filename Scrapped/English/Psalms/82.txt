82  God takes his place in the divine assembly;*+In the middle of the gods* he judges:+ 
 2  “How long will you continue to judge with injustice+And show partiality to the wicked?+ (Selah) 
 3  Defend* the lowly and the fatherless.+ Render justice to the helpless and destitute.+ 
 4  Rescue the lowly and the poor;Save them out of the hand of the wicked.” 
 5  They do not know, nor do they understand;+They are walking about in darkness;All the foundations of the earth are being shaken.+ 
 6  “I have said, ‘You are gods,*+All of you are sons of the Most High. 
 7  But you will die just as men do;+And like any other prince you will fall!’”+ 
 8  Rise up, O God, and judge the earth,+For all the nations belong to you.
