17  Hear my plea for justice, O Jehovah;Pay attention to my cry for help;Listen to my prayer spoken without deceit.+ 
 2  May you make a just decision in my behalf;+May your eyes see what is right. 
 3  You have examined my heart, you have inspected me by night;+You have refined me;+You will find that I have not schemed anything bad,And my mouth has not transgressed. 
 4  As for the activities of men,In accord with the word of your lips, I avoid the paths of the robber.+ 
 5  Let my steps stay on your tracksSo that my feet will not stumble.+ 
 6  I do call on you, because you will answer me,+ O God. Incline your ear* to me. Hear my words.+ 
 7  Show your loyal love in a wonderful way,+O Savior of those seeking refuge at your right handFrom those who rebel against you. 
 8  Guard me like the pupil of your eye;+Conceal me in the shadow of your wings.+ 
 9  Guard me from the wicked who attack me,From my mortal enemies* who surround me.+ 
10  They have become insensitive;*With their mouth they speak arrogantly;
11  Now they hem us in;+They watch for the chance to cause our downfall.* 
12  He is like a lion eager to tear its prey to pieces,Like a young lion crouching in ambush. 
13  Rise up, O Jehovah, to confront him+ and bring him down;Rescue me* from the wicked with your sword;
14  Rescue me with your hand, O Jehovah,From men of this world,* whose share is in this life,+Those whom you fill with the good things you provide+And who leave an inheritance to their many sons. 
15  But as for me, in righteousness I will see your face;I am satisfied to awaken in your presence.*+
