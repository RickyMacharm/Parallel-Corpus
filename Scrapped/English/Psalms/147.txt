147  Praise Jah!* It is good to sing praises* to our God;How pleasant and fitting it is to praise him!+ 
 2  Jehovah is building Jerusalem;+He gathers together the dispersed ones of Israel.+ 
 3  He heals the brokenhearted;He binds up their wounds. 
 4  He counts the number of the stars;He calls all of them by name.+ 
 5  Our Lord is great and is mighty in power;+His understanding is beyond measure.+ 
 6  Jehovah raises up the meek,+But he hurls the wicked to the ground. 
 7  Sing to Jehovah with thanksgiving;Sing praises to our God, accompanied by the harp,
 8  The One who covers the heavens with clouds,The One providing rain for the earth,+The One making grass sprout+ on the mountains. 
 9  To the animals he gives food,+To the young ravens that call out for it.+ 
10  He does not delight in the power of the horse;+Nor is he impressed by the strong legs of a man.+ 
11  Jehovah finds pleasure in those who fear him,+In those waiting for his loyal love.+ 
12  Glorify Jehovah, O Jerusalem. Praise your God, O Zion. 
13  He makes the bars of your city gates strong;He blesses your sons within you. 
14  He brings peace to your territory;+He satisfies you with the finest* wheat.+ 
15  He sends his command to the earth;His word runs swiftly. 
16  He sends the snow like wool;+He scatters the frost just like ashes.+ 
17  He hurls down his hailstones* like morsels of bread.+ Who can withstand his cold?+ 
18  He sends out his word, and they melt. He makes his wind blow,+ and the waters flow. 
19  He declares his word to Jacob,His regulations and judgments to Israel.+ 
20  He has not done so with any other nation;+They know nothing about his judgments. Praise Jah!*+
