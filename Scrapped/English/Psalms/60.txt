60  O God, you rejected us; you broke through our defenses.+ You were angry with us; but now accept us back! 
 2  You caused the earth to quake; you split it open. Repair its breaches, for it is falling. 
 3  You caused your people to suffer hardship. You made us drink wine that makes us stagger.+ 
 4  Give* a signal to those fearing youTo flee and dodge the bow. (Selah) 
 5  So that your loved ones may be rescued,Save us with your right hand and answer us.+ 
 6  God has spoken in his holiness:* “I will exult, I will give out Sheʹchem as an inheritance,+And I will measure off the Valley* of Sucʹcoth.+ 
 7  Gilʹe·ad belongs to me, as does Ma·nasʹseh,+And Eʹphra·im is the helmet* for my head;Judah is my commander’s staff.+ 
 8  Moʹab is my washbasin.+ Over Eʹdom I will throw my sandal.+ Over Phi·lisʹti·a I will shout in triumph.”+ 
 9  Who will bring me to the besieged* city? Who will lead me as far as Eʹdom?+ 
10  Is it not you, O God, who have rejected us,Our God, who no longer goes out with our armies?+ 
11  Help us in our distress,For salvation by humans is worthless.+ 
12  By God we will gain power,+And he will trample on our adversaries.+
