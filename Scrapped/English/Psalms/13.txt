13  How long, O Jehovah, will you forget me? Forever? How long will you hide your face from me?+ 
 2  How long will I* have anxious concern,With grief in my heart each day? How long will my enemy triumph over me?+ 
 3  Look upon me and answer me, O Jehovah my God. Give light to my eyes, so that I may not fall asleep in death,
 4  So that my enemy will not say: “I have defeated him!” Do not let my opponents rejoice over my downfall.+ 
 5  As for me, I trust in your loyal love;+My heart will rejoice in your acts of salvation.+ 
 6  I will sing to Jehovah, for he has richly rewarded me.*+
