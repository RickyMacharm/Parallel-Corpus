9  I will praise you, O Jehovah, with all my heart;I will tell about all your wonderful works.+ 
 2  I will rejoice and exult in you;I will sing praises* to your name, O Most High.+ 
 3  When my enemies retreat,+They will stumble and perish from before you. 
 4  For you defend my just cause;You sit on your throne judging with righteousness.+ 
 5  You have rebuked nations+ and destroyed the wicked,Blotting out their name forever and ever. 
 6  The enemy has been ruined forever;You uprooted their cities,And all memory of them will perish.+ 
 7  But Jehovah is enthroned forever;+He has firmly established his throne for justice.+ 
 8  He will judge the inhabited earth* in righteousness;+He will render righteous legal decisions for the nations.+ 
 9  Jehovah will become a secure refuge* for the oppressed,+A secure refuge in times of distress.+ 
10  Those knowing your name will trust in you;+You will never abandon those seeking you, O Jehovah.+ 
11  Sing praises to Jehovah, who is dwelling in Zion;Make his deeds known among the peoples.+ 
12  For the One who avenges their blood remembers them;+He will not forget the cry of the afflicted.+ 
13  Show me favor, O Jehovah; see my affliction by those hating me,You who raise me from the gates of death,+
14  So that I may declare your praiseworthy deeds in the gates of the daughter of Zion,+And rejoice in your acts of salvation.+ 
15  The nations have sunk down into the pit they made;Their own foot has been caught in the net they hid.+ 
16  Jehovah is known by the judgment he executes.+ The wicked one has been ensnared in the work of his own hands.+ Hig·gaʹion.* (Selah) 
17  The wicked will retreat toward the Grave,*All the nations who forget God. 
18  But the poor will not always be forgotten;+Nor will the hope of the meek ever perish.+ 
19  Rise up, O Jehovah! Do not let mortal man prevail. May the nations be judged in your presence.+ 
20  Strike them with fear, O Jehovah,+Let the nations know that they are only mortal men. (Selah)
