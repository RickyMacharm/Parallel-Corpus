16  Protect me, O God, for I have taken refuge in you.+ 
 2  I have said to Jehovah: “You are Jehovah, my Source of goodness. 
 3  And the holy ones in the earth,The majestic ones, bring me great delight.”+ 
 4  Those who pursue other gods multiply their sorrows.+ I will never pour out their drink offerings of blood,Nor will my lips mention their names.+ 
 5  Jehovah is my portion, my allotted share,+ and my cup.+ You safeguard my inheritance. 
 6  Pleasant places have been measured out to me. Yes, I am content with my inheritance.+ 
 7  I will praise Jehovah, who has given me advice.+ Even during the night, my innermost thoughts* correct me.+ 
 8  I keep Jehovah before me constantly.+ Because he is at my right hand, I will never be shaken.*+ 
 9  So my heart rejoices, my whole being* is joyful. And I reside* in security. 
10  For you will not leave me in* the Grave.*+ You will not allow your loyal one to see the pit.*+ 
11  You make known to me the path of life.+ In your presence* is abundant joy;+There is happiness* at your right hand forever.
