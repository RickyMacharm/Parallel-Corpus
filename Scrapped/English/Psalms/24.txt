24  To Jehovah belong the earth and everything in it,+The productive land and those dwelling on it. 
 2  For he has solidly fixed it on the seas+And firmly established it on the rivers. 
 3  Who may ascend to the mountain of Jehovah,+And who may stand up in his holy place? 
 4  Anyone with innocent hands and a pure heart,+Who has not sworn a false oath by My life,*Nor taken an oath deceitfully.+ 
 5  He will receive blessings from Jehovah+And righteousness* from his God of salvation.+ 
 6  This is the generation of those seeking him,Of those seeking your face, O God of Jacob. (Selah) 
 7  Lift up your heads, you gates;+Open up,* you ancient doorways,That the glorious King may enter!+ 
 8  Who is this glorious King? Jehovah, strong and mighty,+Jehovah, mighty in battle.+ 
 9  Lift up your heads, you gates;+Open up, you ancient doorways,That the glorious King may enter! 
10  Who is he, this glorious King? Jehovah of armiesâ€”he is the glorious King.+ (Selah)
