81  Shout joyfully to God our strength.+ Shout in triumph to the God of Jacob. 
 2  Begin the music and take a tambourine,The melodious harp together with the stringed instrument. 
 3  Blow the horn on the new moon,+On the full moon, for the day of our festival.+ 
 4  For it is a decree for Israel,A ruling of the God of Jacob.+ 
 5  He established it as a reminder for Joseph+When He went out against the land of Egypt.+ I heard a voice* that I did not recognize: 
 6  “I lifted the burden from his shoulder;+His hands were freed from the basket. 
 7  In your distress you called, and I rescued you;+I answered you from the thundercloud.*+ I tested you at the waters of Merʹi·bah.*+ (Selah) 
 8  Hear, my people, and I will testify against you. O Israel, if you would only listen to me.+ 
 9  Among you, there will be no strange god,And you will not bow down to a foreign god.+ 
10  I, Jehovah, am your God,The one who brought you out of the land of Egypt.+ Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.+ 
11  But my people did not listen to my voice;Israel would not submit to me.+ 
12  So I let them follow their stubborn hearts;They did what they thought was right.*+ 
13  If only my people would listen to me,+If only Israel would walk in my ways!+ 
14  Their enemies I would quickly subdue;I would turn my hand against their adversaries.+ 
15  Those who hate Jehovah will cringe in his presence,And their outcome* will be forever. 
16  But he will feed you* with the finest* wheat+And satisfy you with honey from the rock.”+
