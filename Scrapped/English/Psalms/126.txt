126  When Jehovah gathered back the captives of Zion,+We thought we were dreaming. 
 2  At that time our mouth was filled with laughterAnd our tongue with a joyful shout.+ At that time they said among the nations: “Jehovah has done great things for them.”+ 
 3  Jehovah has done great things for us,+And we are overjoyed. 
 4  Do gather back* our captives, O Jehovah,Like streams in the Negʹeb.* 
 5  Those sowing seed with tearsWill reap with a joyful shout. 
 6  The one who does go out, though weeping,Carrying his bag of seed,Will surely return with a joyful shout,+Carrying in his sheaves.+
