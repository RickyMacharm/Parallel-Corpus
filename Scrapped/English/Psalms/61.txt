61  Hear, O God, my cry for help. Do pay attention to my prayer.+ 
 2  From the ends of the earth I will cry out to youWhen my heart is in despair.*+ Lead me onto a rock that is higher than I am.+ 
 3  For you are my refuge,A strong tower that protects me from the enemy.+ 
 4  I will be a guest in your tent forever;+I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings.+ (Selah) 
 5  For you, O God, have heard my vows. You have given me the inheritance belonging to those who fear your name.+ 
 6  You will add days to the life* of the king,+And his years will be from generation to generation. 
 7  He will sit enthroned* forever before God;+Grant him* loyal love and faithfulness, so that these may safeguard him.+ 
 8  Then I will sing praises* to your name forever+As I pay my vows day after day.+
