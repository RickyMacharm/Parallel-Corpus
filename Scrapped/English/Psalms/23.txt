23  Jehovah is my Shepherd.+ I will lack nothing.+ 
 2  In grassy pastures he makes me lie down;He leads me to well-watered resting-places.*+ 
 3  He refreshes me.*+ He leads me in the paths* of righteousness for the sake of his name.+ 
 4  Though I walk in the valley of deep shadow,+I fear no harm,+For you are with me;+Your rod and your staff reassure me.* 
 5  You prepare a table for me before my enemies.+ You refresh* my head with oil;+My cup is well-filled.+ 
 6  Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue me all the days of my life,+And I will dwell in the house of Jehovah for all my days.+
