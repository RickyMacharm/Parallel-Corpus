99  Jehovah has become King.+ Let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned above* the cherubs.+ Let the earth shake. 
 2  Jehovah is great in Zion,And he is high over all the peoples.+ 
 3  Let them praise your great name,+For it is awe-inspiring and holy. 
 4  He is a mighty king who loves justice.+ You have firmly established what is upright. You have brought about justice and righteousness+ in Jacob. 
 5  Exalt Jehovah our God+ and bow down* at his footstool;+He is holy.+ 
 6  Moses and Aaron were among his priests,+And Samuel was among those calling on his name.+ They would call to Jehovah,And he would answer them.+ 
 7  He would speak to them from the pillar of cloud.+ They kept his reminders and the decree that he gave to them.+ 
 8  O Jehovah our God, you answered them.+ You were a God who pardoned them,+But you punished* them for their sinful deeds.+ 
 9  Exalt Jehovah our God+And bow down* before his holy mountain,+For Jehovah our God is holy.+
