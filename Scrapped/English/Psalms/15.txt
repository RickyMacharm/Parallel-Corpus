15  O Jehovah, who may be a guest in your tent? Who may reside in your holy mountain?+ 
 2  The one who is walking faultlessly,*+Practicing what is right+And speaking the truth in his heart.+ 
 3  He does not slander with his tongue,+He does nothing bad to his neighbor,+And he does not defame* his friends.+ 
 4  He rejects anyone who is contemptible,+But he honors those fearing Jehovah. He does not go back on his promise,* even when it is bad for him.+ 
 5  He does not lend his money on interest,+And he does not accept a bribe against the innocent.+ Whoever does these things will never be shaken.*+
