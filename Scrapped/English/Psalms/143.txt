143  O Jehovah, hear my prayer;+Listen to my plea for help. In your faithfulness and in your righteousness, answer me. 
 2  Do not enter into judgment with your servant,For no one living can be righteous before you.+ 
 3  For the enemy pursues me;*He has crushed my life into the ground. He has caused me to dwell in darkness like those long dead. 
 4  My spirit* is failing;+My heart is numb within me.+ 
 5  I remember the days of old;I meditate on all your activity;+I eagerly ponder over* the work of your hands. 
 6  I spread out my hands to you;I am* like a parched land that thirsts for you.+ (Selah) 
 7  Do answer me quickly, O Jehovah;+My strength* has come to an end.+ Do not hide your face from me,+Or I will be like those going down into the pit.*+ 
 8  Let me hear your loyal love in the morning,For I trust in you. Make known to me the way I should walk,+For to you I turn.* 
 9  Rescue me from my enemies, O Jehovah. I seek your protection.+ 
10  Teach me to do your will,+For you are my God. Your spirit is good;May it lead me on level ground.* 
11  For the sake of your name, O Jehovah, preserve me alive. In your righteousness, rescue me* from distress.+ 
12  In your loyal love, put an end to* my enemies;+Destroy all those harassing me,*+For I am your servant.+
