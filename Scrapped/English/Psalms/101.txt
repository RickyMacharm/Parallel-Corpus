101  I will sing about loyal love and justice. To you, O Jehovah, I will sing praises.* 
 2  I will act with discretion and blamelessness.* When will you come to me? I will walk with integrity of heart+ inside my house. 
 3  I will not set anything worthless* before my eyes. I hate the deeds of those who deviate from what is right;+I will have nothing to do with them.* 
 4  A crooked heart is far from me;I will not accept* what is bad. 
 5  Anyone slandering his neighbor in secret,+I will silence.* Anyone with haughty eyes and an arrogant heart,I will not tolerate. 
 6  I will look to the faithful ones of the earth,So that they may dwell with me. The one walking in blamelessness* will minister to me. 
 7  No deceitful person will dwell in my house,And no liar will stand in my presence.* 
 8  Every morning I will silence* all the wicked of the earth,To cut off all wrongdoers from the city of Jehovah.+
