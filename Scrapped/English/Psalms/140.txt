140  Rescue me, O Jehovah, from evil men;Protect me from violent men,+
 2  Those who scheme evil in their hearts+And stir up conflict all day long. 
 3  They sharpen their tongue like that of a serpent;+Venom of vipers is behind their lips.+ (Selah) 
 4  Protect me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked;+Safeguard me from violent men,Those who scheme to trip me. 
 5  The haughty ones hide a trap for me;With ropes they spread out a net beside the path.+ They set snares for me.+ (Selah) 
 6  I say to Jehovah: “You are my God. Listen, O Jehovah, to my pleas for help.”+ 
 7  O Jehovah the Sovereign Lord, my strong Savior,You shield my head in the day of battle.+ 
 8  Do not grant, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked. Do not let their plots succeed, so that they are not exalted.+ (Selah) 
 9  May the heads of those surrounding meBe covered with the evil spoken by their lips.+ 
10  May burning coals rain down on them.+ May they be hurled into the fire,Into deep pits,*+ never to rise again. 
11  May the slanderer find no place on the earth.*+ May evil pursue men of violence and strike them down. 
12  I know that Jehovah will defend the lowlyAnd give justice to the poor.+ 
13  Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name;The upright will dwell before your face.*+
