96  Sing to Jehovah a new song.+ Sing to Jehovah, all the earth!+ 
 2  Sing to Jehovah; praise his name. Proclaim the good news of his salvation day after day.+ 
 3  Declare his glory among the nations,His wonderful works among all the peoples.+ 
 4  Jehovah is great and most worthy of praise. He is more awe-inspiring than all other gods. 
 5  All the gods of the peoples are worthless gods,+But Jehovah is the one who made the heavens.+ 
 6  In his presence are majesty* and splendor;+Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.+ 
 7  Give Jehovah his due, you families of the peoples,Give Jehovah his due for his glory and strength.+ 
 8  Give Jehovah the glory due his name;+Bring a gift and come into his courtyards. 
 9  Bow down to* Jehovah in holy adornment;*Tremble before him, all the earth! 
10  Declare among the nations: “Jehovah has become King!+ The earth* is firmly established, it cannot be moved.* He will judge* the peoples fairly.”+ 
11  Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be joyful;Let the sea thunder and all that fills it;+
12  Let the fields and everything in them rejoice.+ At the same time let all the trees of the forest shout joyfully+
13  Before Jehovah, for he is coming,*He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the inhabited earth* with righteousness+And the peoples with his faithfulness.+
