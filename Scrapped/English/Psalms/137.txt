137  By the rivers of Babylon,+ there we sat. We wept when we remembered Zion.+ 
 2  Upon the poplar trees in her* midst,We hung our harps.+ 
 3  For there our captors asked us for a song,+Those mocking us wanted amusement: “Sing for us one of the songs of Zion.” 
 4  How can we sing the song of JehovahOn foreign soil? 
 5  If I should forget you, O Jerusalem,Let my right hand be forgetful.*+ 
 6  Let my tongue stick to my palateIf I do not remember you,If I do not place Jerusalem aboveMy greatest reasons for rejoicing.+ 
 7  Remember, O Jehovah,What the Eʹdom·ites said on the day Jerusalem fell: “Tear it down! Tear it down to its foundations!”+ 
 8  O daughter of Babylon, who is soon to be devastated,+Happy will be the one who rewards youWith the treatment you inflicted on us.+ 
 9  Happy will be the one who seizes your childrenAnd dashes them against the rocks.+
