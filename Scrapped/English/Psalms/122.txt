122  I rejoiced when they said to me: “Let us go to the house of Jehovah.”+ 
 2  And now our feet are standingWithin your gates, O Jerusalem.+ 
 3  Jerusalem is built as a cityThat is joined together as one.+ 
 4  The tribes have gone up to it,The tribes of Jah,*According to the reminder to Israel,To give thanks to the name of Jehovah.+ 
 5  For thrones for judgment were set up there,+Thrones of the house of David.+ 
 6  Ask for the peace of Jerusalem.+ Those who love you, O city, will be secure. 
 7  May peace continue within your ramparts,*Security within your fortified towers. 
 8  For the sake of my brothers and my companions I will say: “May there be peace within you.” 
 9  For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God,+I will seek good for you.
