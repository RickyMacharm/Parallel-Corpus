92  It is good to give thanks to Jehovah+And to sing praises* to your name, O Most High,
 2  To declare your loyal love+ in the morningAnd your faithfulness during the nights,
 3  Accompanied by a ten-stringed instrument and a lute,By the melodious sound of a harp.+ 
 4  For you have made me rejoice, O Jehovah, because of your deeds;Because of the works of your hands I shout joyfully. 
 5  How great your works are, O Jehovah!+ How very deep your thoughts are!+ 
 6  No unreasoning man can know them;And no foolish person can understand this:+ 
 7  When the wicked sprout like weeds*And all the wrongdoers flourish,It is that they may be annihilated forever.+ 
 8  But you are exalted forever, O Jehovah. 
 9  Indeed, look in triumph on your enemies, O Jehovah,Look at how your enemies will perish;All the wrongdoers will be scattered.+ 
10  But you will exalt my strength* like that of a wild bull;I will moisten my skin with fresh oil.+ 
11  My eyes will look in triumph on my foes;+My ears will hear about the downfall of the evil men who attack me. 
12  But the righteous will flourish like a palm treeAnd grow big like a cedar in Lebʹa·non.+ 
13  They are planted in the house of Jehovah;They flourish in the courtyards of our God.+ 
14  Even in old age* they will still be thriving;+They will remain vigorous* and fresh,+
15  Declaring that Jehovah is upright. He is my Rock,+ in whom there is no unrighteousness.
