132  O Jehovah, remember DavidAnd all his suffering;+
 2  How he swore to Jehovah,How he vowed to the Powerful One of Jacob:+ 
 3  “I will not go into my tent, my home.+ I will not lie upon my couch, my bed;
 4  I will not allow my eyes to sleep,Nor my eyelids to slumber
 5  Until I find a place for Jehovah,A fine residence* for the Powerful One of Jacob.”+ 
 6  Look! We heard about it in Ephʹra·thah;+We found it in the fields of the forest.+ 
 7  Let us come into his residence;*+Let us bow down at his footstool.+ 
 8  Rise up, O Jehovah, to come to your resting-place,+You and the Ark of your strength.+ 
 9  May your priests be clothed with righteousness,And may your loyal ones shout joyfully. 
10  For the sake of David your servant,Do not reject* your anointed one.+ 
11  Jehovah has sworn to David;He will surely not go back on his word: “One of your offspring,*I will place on your throne.+ 
12  If your sons keep my covenantAnd my reminders that I teach them,+Their sons tooWill sit on your throne forever.”+ 
13  For Jehovah has chosen Zion;+He has desired it for his dwelling place:+ 
14  “This is my resting-place forever;Here I will dwell,+ for this is my desire. 
15  I will richly bless it with provisions;I will satisfy its poor with bread.+ 
16  Its priests I will clothe with salvation,+And its loyal ones will shout joyfully.+ 
17  There I will make the strength* of David grow. I have prepared a lamp for my anointed one.+ 
18  I will clothe his enemies with shame,But the crown* on his head will flourish.”+
