114  When Israel went out of Egypt,+The house of Jacob from a people speaking a foreign language,
 2  Judah became his sanctuary,*Israel, his dominion.+ 
 3  The sea saw it and fled;+The Jordan turned back.+ 
 4  The mountains skipped about like rams,+The hills, like lambs. 
 5  What made you flee, O sea?+ Why, O Jordan, did you turn back?+ 
 6  Why did you skip about like rams, O mountains,Like lambs, O hills? 
 7  Tremble, O earth, because of the Lord,Because of the God of Jacob,+
 8  Who turns the rock into a reedy pool of water,The flinty rock into springs of water.+
