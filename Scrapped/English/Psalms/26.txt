26  Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in my integrity;+In Jehovah I have trusted without wavering.+ 
 2  Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test;Refine my innermost thoughts* and my heart.+ 
 3  For your loyal love is always in front of me,And I walk in your truth.+ 
 4  I do not associate* with deceitful men,+And I avoid those who hide what they are.* 
 5  I hate the company of evil men,+And I refuse to associate* with the wicked.+ 
 6  I will wash my hands in innocence,And I will march around your altar, O Jehovah,
 7  To cause the sound of thanksgiving to be heard+And to declare all your wonderful works. 
 8  Jehovah, I love the house where you dwell,+The place where your glory resides.+ 
 9  Do not sweep me* away with sinners+Nor take my life away with violent men,*
10  Whose hands engage in shameful conduct,And whose right hand is full of bribes. 
11  But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Rescue* me and show me favor. 
12  My foot is standing on level ground;+In the great congregation,* I will praise Jehovah.+
