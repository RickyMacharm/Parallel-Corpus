133  Look! How good and how pleasant it isFor brothers to dwell together in unity!+ 
 2  It is like fine oil poured on the head+That runs down the beard,Aaron’s beard,+And runs down onto the collar of his garments. 
 3  It is like the dew of Herʹmon+That descends on the mountains of Zion.+ That is where Jehovah decreed his blessing—Life everlasting.
