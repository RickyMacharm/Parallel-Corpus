25  To you, O Jehovah, I turn.* 
 2  My God, I trust in you;+Do not let me be put to shame.+ Do not let my enemies gloat over me.+ 
 3  Surely none who hope in you will be put to shame,+But shame awaits those who are treacherous without cause.+ 
 4  Make me know your ways, O Jehovah;+Teach me your paths.+ 
 5  Cause me to walk in your truth and teach me,+For you are my God of salvation. ×• [Waw] In you I hope all day long. 
 6  Remember your mercy, O Jehovah, and your loyal love,+Which you have always shown.*+ 
 7  Do not remember the sins of my youth and my transgressions. Remember me according to your loyal love,+For the sake of your goodness, O Jehovah.+ 
 8  Good and upright is Jehovah.+ That is why he instructs sinners in the way to live.+ 
 9  He will guide the meek in what is right,*+And he will teach the meek ones his way.+ 
10  All the paths of Jehovah are loyal love and faithfulnessFor those observing his covenant+ and his reminders.+ 
11  For the sake of your name, O Jehovah,+Forgive my error, though it is great. 
12  Who is the man fearing Jehovah?+ He will instruct him about the way he should choose.+ 
13  He* will experience what is good,+And his descendants* will take possession of the earth.+ 
14  Close friendship with Jehovah belongs to those who fear him,+And he makes his covenant known to them.+ 
15  My eyes are always toward Jehovah,+For he will free my feet from the net.+ 
16  Turn your face to me and show me favor,For I am alone and helpless. 
17  The distresses of my heart have multiplied;+Free me from my anguish. 
18  See my affliction and my trouble,+And pardon all my sins.+ 
19  See how numerous my enemies areAnd how violent their hatred is for me. 
20  Guard my life* and save me.+ Do not let me be put to shame, for I have taken refuge in you. 
21  May integrity and uprightness safeguard me,+For my hope is in you.+ 
22  O God, rescue* Israel out of all his distresses.
