131  O Jehovah, my heart is not haughty,Nor are my eyes lofty;+Nor do I aspire to things too great,+Or to things that are beyond me. 
 2  No, but I have calmed and quieted my soul*+Like a weaned child with its mother;I am* contented like a weaned child. 
 3  Let Israel wait for Jehovah+From now on and forever.
