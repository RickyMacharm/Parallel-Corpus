1  Happy is the man who does not walk according to the advice of the wickedAnd does not stand on the path of sinners+And does not sit in the seat of scoffers.+ 
 2  But his delight is in the law of Jehovah,+And he reads His law in an undertone* day and night.+ 
 3  He will be like a tree planted by streams of water,A tree that produces fruit in its season,The foliage of which does not wither. And everything he does will succeed.+ 
 4  The wicked are not like that;They are like the chaff that the wind blows away. 
 5  That is why the wicked will not remain standing in the judgment;+Nor will sinners remain standing in the assembly of the righteous.+ 
 6  For Jehovah is aware of the way of the righteous,+But the way of the wicked will perish.+
