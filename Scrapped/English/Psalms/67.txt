67  God will show us favor and bless us;He will make his face shine upon us+ (Selah) 
 2  So that your way may be known throughout the earth,+Your acts of salvation among all the nations.+ 
 3  Let peoples praise you, O God;Let all the peoples praise you. 
 4  Let nations rejoice and shout joyfully,+For you will judge the peoples fairly.+ You will guide the nations of the earth. (Selah) 
 5  Let peoples praise you, O God;Let all the peoples praise you. 
 6  The earth will give its produce;+God, our God, will bless us.+ 
 7  God will bless us,And all the ends of the earth will fear* him.+
