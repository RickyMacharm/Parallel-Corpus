2  And all his powerful and mighty accomplishments, as well as the detailed account of Morʹde·cai’s+ greatness to which the king exalted him,+ are they not written in the book of the history of the times+ of the kings of Meʹdi·a and Persia?+
3  For Morʹde·cai the Jew was second only to King A·has·u·eʹrus. He was great* among the Jews and respected by the multitude of his brothers, working for the good of his people and advocating the welfare of* all their descendants.
