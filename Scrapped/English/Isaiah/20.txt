20  In the year that King Sarʹgon of As·syrʹi·a sent the Tarʹtan* to Ashʹdod,+ he fought against Ashʹdod and captured it.+
2  At that time Jehovah spoke through Isaiah+ the son of Aʹmoz, saying: “Go, remove the sackcloth from your hips, and take your sandals off your feet.” And he did so, walking about naked* and barefoot. 
3  Jehovah then said: “Just as my servant Isaiah has walked about naked and barefoot for three years as a sign+ and a portent against Egypt+ and E·thi·oʹpi·a,+
4  so the king of As·syrʹi·a will lead the captives of Egypt+ and the exiles of E·thi·oʹpi·a, boys and old men, naked and barefoot and with exposed buttocks, the nakedness* of Egypt.
5  And they will be terrified and will be ashamed of E·thi·oʹpi·a their hope and of Egypt their pride.*
6  The inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, ‘Look at what happened to our hope, to which we fled for help and rescue from the king of As·syrʹi·a! How will we escape now?’”
