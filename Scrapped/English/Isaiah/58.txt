58  “Call out full-throated; do not hold back! Raise your voice like a horn. Proclaim to my people their revolt,+To the house of Jacob their sins. 
 2  They seek me day after day,And they express delight to know my ways,As if they were a nation that had practiced righteousnessAnd had not abandoned the justice of their God.+ They ask me for righteous judgments,Delighting to draw close to God:+ 
 3  ‘Why do you not see when we fast?+ And why do you not notice when we afflict ourselves?’*+ Because on the day of your fast, you pursue your own interests,*And you oppress your laborers.+ 
 4  Your fasting ends in quarrels and fights,And you strike with the fist of wickedness. You cannot fast as you do today and have your voice heard in heaven. 
 5  Should the fast that I choose be like this,As a day for someone to afflict himself,*To bow down his head like a rush,To make his bed on sackcloth and ashes? Is this what you call a fast and a day pleasing to Jehovah? 
 6  No, this is the fast that I choose: To remove the fetters of wickedness,To untie the bands of the yoke bar,+To let the oppressed go free,+And to break in half every yoke bar;
 7  It is to share your bread with the hungry,+To bring the poor and homeless into your house,To clothe someone naked when you see him,+And not to turn your back on your own flesh. 
 8  Then your light will shine through like the dawn,+And your healing will spring up quickly. Your righteousness will go before you,And the glory of Jehovah will be your rear guard.+ 
 9  Then you will call, and Jehovah will answer;You will cry for help, and he will say, ‘Here I am!’ If you remove from among you the yoke barAnd stop pointing your finger and speaking maliciously,+
10  If you grant to the hungry what you yourself desire*+And satisfy those who are afflicted,*Then your light will shine even in the darkness,And your gloom will be like midday.+ 
11  Jehovah will always lead youAnd satisfy you* even in a parched land;+He will invigorate your bones,And you will become like a well-watered garden,+Like a spring whose waters never fail. 
12  They will rebuild ancient ruins on your account,+And you will restore the foundations of past generations.+ You will be called the repairer of the broken walls,*+The restorer of roadways by which to dwell. 
13  If because of the Sabbath you refrain* from pursuing your own interests* on my holy day+And you call the Sabbath an exquisite delight, a holy day of Jehovah, a day to be glorified,+And you glorify it rather than pursuing your own interests and speaking idle words,
14  Then you will find your exquisite delight in Jehovah,And I will make you ride on the high places of the earth.+ I will cause you to eat from* the inheritance of Jacob your forefather,+For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.”
