4  And seven women will grab hold of one man in that day,+ saying: “We will eat our own breadAnd wear our own clothing;Only let us be called by your nameTo take away our disgrace.”*+ 
2  In that day what Jehovah makes sprout will be splendid and glorious, and the fruitage of the land will be the pride and beauty of the survivors of Israel.+
3  Whoever remains in Zion and is left over in Jerusalem will be called holy, all of those in Jerusalem written down for life.+ 
4  When Jehovah washes away the filth* of the daughters of Zion+ and rinses away the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst by the spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning,*+
5  Jehovah will also create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over the place of her conventions a cloud and smoke by day and a bright flaming fire by night;+ for over all the glory there will be a shelter.
6  And there will be a booth for shade by day from the heat,+ and for refuge and protection from storms and the rain.+
