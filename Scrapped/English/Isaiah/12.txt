12  In that day you will certainly say: “I thank you, O Jehovah,For although you were angry with me,Your anger gradually subsided, and you comforted me.+ 
 2  Look! God is my salvation.+ I will trust and feel no dread;+For Jah* Jehovah is my strength and my might,And he has become my salvation.”+ 
 3  With rejoicing you will draw waterFrom the springs of salvation.+ 
 4  And in that day you will say: “Give thanks to Jehovah, call on his name,Make his deeds known among the peoples!+ Declare that his name is exalted.+ 
 5  Sing praises* to Jehovah,+ for he has done magnificent things.+ Let this be made known in all the earth. 
 6  Cry out and shout for joy, you inhabitant* of Zion,For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.”
