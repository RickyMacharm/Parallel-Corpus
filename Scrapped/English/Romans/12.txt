12  Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassions of God, brothers, to present your bodies+ as a living sacrifice, holy+ and acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason.+
2  And stop being molded by this system of things,* but be transformed by making your mind over,+ so that you may prove to yourselves+ the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. 
3  For through the undeserved kindness given to me, I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think,+ but to think so as to have a sound mind, each one as God has given* to him a measure of faith.+
4  For just as we have in one body many members,+ but the members do not all have the same function,
5  so we, although many, are one body in union with Christ, but individually we are members belonging to one another.+
6  Since, then, we have gifts that differ according to the undeserved kindness given to us,+ if it is of prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith;
7  or if it is a ministry, let us be at this ministry; or the one who teaches, let him be at his teaching;+
8  or the one who encourages,* let him give encouragement;*+ the one who distributes,* let him do it liberally;+ the one who presides,* let him do it diligently;*+ the one who shows mercy, let him do it cheerfully.+ 
9  Let your love be without hypocrisy.+ Abhor what is wicked;+ cling to what is good.
10  In brotherly love have tender affection for one another. In showing honor to one another, take the lead.*+
11  Be industrious,* not lazy.*+ Be aglow with the spirit.+ Slave for Jehovah.*+
12  Rejoice in the hope. Endure under tribulation.+ Persevere in prayer.+
13  Share with the holy ones according to their needs.+ Follow the course of hospitality.+
14  Keep on blessing those who persecute;+ bless and do not curse.+
15  Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.
16  Have the same attitude toward others as toward yourselves; do not set your mind on lofty things,* but be led along with the lowly things.+ Do not become wise in your own eyes.+ 
17  Return evil for evil to no one.+ Take into consideration what is fine from the viewpoint of* all men.
18  If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men.+
19  Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath;*+ for it is written: “‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay,’ says Jehovah.”*+
20  But “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this you will heap fiery coals on his head.”*+
21  Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.+
