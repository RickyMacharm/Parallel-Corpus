2  You, however, keep on speaking what is consistent with wholesome* teaching.+
2  Let the older men be moderate in habits, serious, sound in mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance.
3  Likewise, let the older women be reverent in behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to a lot of wine, teachers of what is good,
4  so that they may advise* the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children,
5  to be sound in mind, chaste, working at home,* good, subjecting themselves to their own husbands,+ so that the word of God may not be spoken of abusively. 
6  Likewise, keep on urging the younger men to be sound in mind,+
7  showing yourself to be an example of fine works in every way. Teach what is pure* with all seriousness,+
8  using wholesome* speech that cannot be criticized,+ so that those who oppose may be put to shame, having nothing negative* to say about us.+
9  Let slaves be in subjection to their owners in all things,+ trying to please them, not talking back,
10  not stealing from them,+ but showing complete trustworthiness, so that in every way they may adorn the teaching of our Savior, God.+ 
11  For the undeserved kindness of God has been manifested, bringing salvation to all sorts of people.+
12  It trains us to reject ungodliness and worldly desires+ and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things,*+
13  while we wait for the happy hope+ and glorious manifestation of the great God and of our Savior, Jesus Christ,
14  who gave himself for us+ to set us free*+ from every sort of lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people who are his own special possession, zealous for fine works.+ 
15  Keep on speaking these things and exhorting* and reproving with full authority.+ Do not let anyone look down on you.
