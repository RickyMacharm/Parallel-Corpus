45  This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Barʹuch+ the son of Ne·riʹah when he wrote in a book these words dictated by Jeremiah+ in the fourth year of Je·hoiʹa·kim+ son of Jo·siʹah, the king of Judah: 
2  “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says concerning you, Barʹuch,
3  ‘You have said: “Woe to me, for Jehovah has added grief to my pain! I am weary from my groaning, and I have found no resting-place.”’ 
4  “You should say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “Look! What I have built up I am tearing down, and what I have planted I am uprooting—the entire land.+
5  But you are seeking* great things for yourself. Stop seeking such things.”’ “‘For I am about to bring a calamity on all flesh,’*+ declares Jehovah, ‘and wherever you may go, I will grant you your life* as a spoil.’”*+
