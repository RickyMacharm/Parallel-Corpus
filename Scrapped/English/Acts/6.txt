6  Now in those days when the disciples were increasing, the Greek-speaking Jews began complaining against the Hebrew-speaking Jews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.+
2  So the Twelve called the multitude of the disciples together and said: “It is not right* for us to leave the word of God to distribute food to tables.+
3  So, brothers, select for yourselves seven reputable men*+ from among you, full of spirit and wisdom,+ that we may appoint them over this necessary matter;+
4  but we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”
5  What they said was pleasing to the whole multitude, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and holy spirit, as well as Philip,+ Prochʹo·rus, Ni·caʹnor, Tiʹmon, Parʹme·nas, and Nic·o·laʹus, a proselyte of Antioch.
6  They brought them to the apostles, and after praying, they laid their hands on them.+ 
7  Consequently, the word of God continued to spread,+ and the number of the disciples kept multiplying very much+ in Jerusalem; and a large crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith.+ 
8  Now Stephen, full of divine favor and power, was performing great wonders* and signs among the people.
9  But some men of the so-called Synagogue of the Freedmen came forward, along with some Cy·reʹni·ans and Alexandrians, and some from Ci·liʹcia and Asia, to dispute with Stephen.
10  But they could not hold their own against the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking.+
11  Then they secretly persuaded men to say: “We have heard him speaking blasphemous things against Moses and God.”
12  And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and coming upon him suddenly, they forcibly seized him and led him to the Sanʹhe·drin.
13  And they brought forward false witnesses, who said: “This man does not stop speaking things against this holy place and against the Law.
14  For instance, we have heard him say that this Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ will throw down this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.” 
15  And as all those sitting in the Sanʹhe·drin stared at him, they saw that his face was like an angel’s face.
