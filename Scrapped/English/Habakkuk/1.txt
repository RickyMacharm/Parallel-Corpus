1  A pronouncement that Ha·bakʹkuk* the prophet received in a vision: 
 2  How long, O Jehovah, must I cry for help, but you do not hear?+ How long must I ask for help from violence, but you do not intervene?*+ 
 3  Why do you make me witness wrongdoing? And why do you tolerate oppression? Why are destruction and violence before me? And why do quarreling and conflict abound? 
 4  So law is paralyzed,And justice is never carried out. For the wicked surround the righteous;That is why justice is perverted.+ 
 5  “Look among the nations and pay attention! Stare in amazement and be astounded;For something will happen in your daysThat you will not believe even if it is told to you.+ 
 6  For here I am raising up the Chal·deʹans,+The ruthless and impetuous nation. They sweep through vast stretches of the earthTo seize homes not theirs.+ 
 7  They are frightening and fearsome. They establish their own justice and authority.*+ 
 8  Their horses are swifter than leopards,And they are fiercer than wolves in the night.+ Their warhorses gallop forward;Their horses come from far away. They swoop down like the eagle rushing to feed.+ 
 9  All of them come bent on violence.+ The assembling of their faces is like the east wind,+And they scoop up captives like sand. 
10  They scoff at kingsAnd laugh at high officials.+ They laugh at every fortified place;+They pile up a dirt ramp and capture it. 
11  Then they move forward like the wind and pass through,But they will become guilty,+Because they credit their power to their god.”*+ 
12  Are you not from everlasting, O Jehovah?+ O my God, my Holy One, you do not die.*+ O Jehovah, you appointed them to execute judgment;My Rock,+ you established them for punishment.*+ 
13  Your eyes are too pure to look on what is evil,And you cannot tolerate wickedness.+ Why, then, do you tolerate the treacherous+And keep silent when a wicked man swallows up someone more righteous than he is?+ 
14  Why do you make man like the fish of the sea,Like creeping things that have no ruler? 
15  All of these he* hauls up with a fishhook. He catches them in his dragnet,And he gathers them in his fishing net. That is why he rejoices greatly.+ 
16  That is why he offers sacrifices to his dragnetAnd makes sacrifices* to his fishing net;For by them his portion is rich,*And his food is choice. 
17  Will he then keep emptying out his dragnet?* Will he go on slaughtering nations without compassion?+
