33  Now this is the blessing that Moses the man of the true God pronounced on the Israelites before his death.+
2  He said: “Jehovah—from Siʹnai he came,+And he shone upon them from Seʹir. He shone forth in glory from the mountainous region of Paʹran,+And with him were holy myriads,*+At his right hand his warriors.+ 
 3  He had affection for his people;+All their holy ones are in your hand.+ They were sitting at your feet;+They began to listen to your words.+ 
 4  (Moses gave us a command, a law,+As a possession of the congregation of Jacob.)+ 
 5  And He became king in Jeshʹu·run,*+When the heads of the people gathered together,+Along with all the tribes of Israel.+ 
 6  Let Reuʹben live and not die off,+And may his men not become few.”+ 
 7  And he pronounced this blessing on Judah:+ “Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah,+And may you bring him back to his people. His arms have defended* what belongs to him,And may you help him against his adversaries.”+ 
 8  Of Leʹvi he said:+ “Your* Thumʹmim and your Uʹrim+ belong to the man loyal to you,+Whom you put to the test at Masʹsah.+ You began to contend with him by the waters of Merʹi·bah,+
 9  The man who said to his father and his mother, ‘I have not shown regard to them.’ Even his brothers he did not acknowledge,+And he ignored his own sons. For they kept your word,And they observed your covenant.+ 
10  Let them instruct Jacob in your judicial decisions+And Israel in your Law.+ Let them offer up incense as a pleasant aroma for you*+And a whole offering on your altar.+ 
11  Bless, O Jehovah, his strength,And may you show pleasure in the work of his hands. Crush the legs* of those who rise up against him,So that those who hate him may rise up no more.” 
12  Of Benjamin he said:+ “Let the beloved one of Jehovah reside in security by him;While he shelters him the whole day,He will reside between his shoulders.” 
13  Of Joseph he said:+ “May his land be blessed by Jehovah+With the choice things of heaven,With dew and the waters from the springs below,+
14  With choice things produced by the sunAnd the choice yield each month,+
15  With the choicest things from the ancient mountains*+And choice things of the enduring hills,
16  With the choice things of the earth and what fills it,+And with the approval of the One residing in the thornbush.+ May they come upon the head of Joseph,On the crown of the head of the one singled out from his brothers.+ 
17  His splendor is like that of a firstborn bull,And his horns are the horns of a wild bull. With them he will push* peoplesAll together to the ends of the earth. They are the tens of thousands of Eʹphra·im,+And they are the thousands of Ma·nasʹseh.” 
18  Of Zebʹu·lun he said:+ “Rejoice, O Zebʹu·lun, in your going out,And you, Isʹsa·char, in your tents.+ 
19  They will call peoples to the mountain. There they will offer the sacrifices of righteousness. For they will draw from the abundant wealth of* the seasAnd the hidden hoards* of the sand.” 
20  Of Gad he said:+ “Blessed is the one widening the borders of Gad.+ He lies there like a lion,Ready to tear off the arm, yes, the crown of the head. 
21  He will select the first portion for himself,+For there the allotment of a lawgiver is reserved.+ The heads of the people will gather together. The righteousness of Jehovah he will execute,And his judicial decisions with Israel.” 
22  Of Dan he said:+ “Dan is a lion cub.+ He will leap out from Baʹshan.”+ 
23  Of Naphʹta·li he said:+ “Naphʹta·li is satisfied with the approvalAnd full of the blessing of Jehovah. Take possession of the west and south.” 
24  Of Ashʹer he said:+ “Blessed with sons is Ashʹer. May he be favored by his brothers,And may he dip* his feet in oil. 
25  Iron and copper are your gate locks,+And you will be secure all your days.* 
26  There is none like the true God+ of Jeshʹu·run,+Who rides through heaven to help youAnd who rides upon the clouds in his majesty.+ 
27  God is a refuge from ancient times,+His everlasting arms are beneath you.+ And he will drive away the enemy from before you,+And he will say, ‘Annihilate them!’+ 
28  Israel will reside in security,And the fountain of Jacob will be secludedIn a land of grain and new wine,+Whose skies will drip with dew.+ 
29  Happy you are, O Israel!+ Who is there like you,+A people enjoying salvation in Jehovah,+Your protective shield+And your majestic sword? Your enemies will cringe before you,+And you will tread on their backs.”*
