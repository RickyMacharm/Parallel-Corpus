2  First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be made concerning all sorts of men,
2  concerning kings and all those who are in high positions,*+ so that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with complete godly devotion and seriousness.+
3  This is fine and acceptable in the sight of our Savior, God,+
4  whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved+ and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.
5  For there is one God,+ and one mediator+ between God and men,+ a man, Christ Jesus,+
6  who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all*+—this is what is to be witnessed to in its own due time.
7  For the purpose of this witness+ I was appointed a preacher and an apostle+—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—a teacher of nations+ in the matter of faith and truth. 
8  So I desire that in every place the men carry on prayer, lifting up loyal hands,+ without anger+ and debates.+
9  Likewise, the women should adorn themselves in appropriate* dress, with modesty and soundness of mind,* not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing,+
10  but in the way that is proper for women professing devotion to God,+ namely, through good works. 
11  Let a woman learn in silence* with full submissiveness.+
12  I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but she is to remain silent.*+
13  For Adam was formed first, then Eve.+
14  Also, Adam was not deceived, but the woman was thoroughly deceived+ and became a transgressor.
15  However, she will be kept safe through childbearing,+ provided she* continues in faith and love and holiness along with soundness of mind.*+
