3  This statement is trustworthy: If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,+ he is desirous of a fine work.
2  The overseer should therefore be irreprehensible, a husband of one wife, moderate in habits, sound in mind,*+ orderly, hospitable,+ qualified to teach,+
3  not a drunkard,+ not violent,* but reasonable,+ not quarrelsome,+ not a lover of money,+
4  a man presiding over* his own household in a fine manner, having his children in subjection with all seriousness+
5  (for if any man does not know how to preside over* his own household, how will he care for the congregation of God?),
6  not a newly converted man,+ for fear that he might get puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed on the Devil.
7  Moreover, he should also have a fine testimony* from outsiders+ so that he does not fall into reproach* and a snare of the Devil. 
8  Ministerial servants should likewise be serious, not double-tongued,* not indulging in a lot of wine, not greedy of dishonest gain,+
9  holding the sacred secret of the faith with a clean conscience.+ 
10  Also, let these be tested as to fitness* first; then let them serve as ministers, as they are free from accusation.+ 
11  Women should likewise be serious, not slanderous,+ moderate in habits, faithful in all things.+ 
12  Let ministerial servants be husbands of one wife, presiding in a fine manner over their children and their own households.
13  For the men who minister in a fine manner are acquiring for themselves a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. 
14  I am writing you these things, though I am hoping to come to you shortly,
15  but in case I am delayed, so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in God’s household,+ which is the congregation of the living God, a pillar and support of the truth.
16  Indeed, the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admittedly great: ‘He was made manifest in flesh,+ was declared righteous in spirit,+ appeared to angels,+ was preached about among nations,+ was believed upon in the world,+ was received up in glory.’
