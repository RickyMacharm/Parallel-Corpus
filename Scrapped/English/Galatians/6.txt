6  Brothers, even if a man takes a false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness.+ But keep an eye on yourself,+ for fear you too may be tempted.+
2  Go on carrying the burdens of one another,+ and in this way you will fulfill the law of the Christ.+
3  For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing,+ he is deceiving himself.
4  But let each one examine his own actions,+ and then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.+
5  For each one will carry his own load.*+ 
6  Moreover, let anyone who is being taught* the word share in all good things with the one who gives such teaching.*+ 
7  Do not be misled: God is not one to be mocked. For whatever a person is sowing, this he will also reap;+
8  because the one sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh, but the one sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.+
9  So let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out.*+
10  So, then, as long as we have the opportunity,* let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith. 
11  See with what large letters I have written you with my own hand. 
12  All those who want to make a good impression in the flesh* are the ones who try to compel you to get circumcised, doing so only to avoid being persecuted for the torture stake* of the Christ.
13  For even those who are getting circumcised do not keep the Law themselves,+ but they want you to be circumcised so that they may have cause for boasting about your flesh.
14  But may I never boast, except in the torture stake* of our Lord Jesus Christ,+ through whom the world has been put to death* with regard to me and I with regard to the world.
15  For neither is circumcision anything nor is uncircumcision,+ but a new creation is.+
16  As for all those who walk orderly by this rule of conduct, peace and mercy be upon them, yes, upon the Israel of God.+ 
17  From now on let no one make trouble for me, for I am bearing on my body the brand marks of a slave of Jesus.+ 
18  The undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit you show, brothers. Amen.
