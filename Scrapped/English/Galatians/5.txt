5  For such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore, stand firm,+ and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.+ 
2  See! I, Paul, am telling you that if you become circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.+
3  Again I bear witness to every man who gets circumcised that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.+
4  You are separated from Christ, you who are trying to be declared righteous by means of law;+ you have fallen away from his undeserved kindness.
5  For our part, we are by spirit eagerly waiting for the hoped-for righteousness resulting from faith.
6  For in union with Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any value,+ but faith operating through love is. 
7  You were running well.+ Who hindered you from continuing to obey the truth?
8  This sort of persuasion does not come from the One calling you.
9  A little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough.+
10  I am confident that you who are in union with the Lord+ will not come to think otherwise; but the one who is causing you trouble,+ whoever he may be, will receive the judgment he deserves.
11  As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the torture stake*+ has been eliminated.
12  I wish the men who are trying to unsettle you would emasculate themselves.* 
13  You were called to freedom, brothers; only do not use this freedom as an opportunity to pursue fleshly desires,+ but through love slave for one another.+
14  For the entire Law has been fulfilled* in one commandment, namely: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”+
15  If, though, you keep on biting and devouring one another,+ look out that you do not get annihilated by one another.+ 
16  But I say, Keep walking by spirit+ and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all.+
17  For the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you do not do the very things you want to do.+
18  Furthermore, if you are being led by spirit, you are not under law. 
19  Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen, and they are sexual immorality,*+ uncleanness, brazen conduct,*+
20  idolatry, spiritism,*+ hostility, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, dissensions, divisions, sects,
21  envy, drunkenness,+ wild parties,* and things like these.+ I am forewarning you about these things, the same way I already warned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.+ 
22  On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,* kindness, goodness,+ faith,
23  mildness, self-control.+ Against such things there is no law.
24  Moreover, those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed to the stake the flesh together with its passions and desires.+ 
25  If we are living by spirit, let us also go on walking orderly by spirit.+
26  Let us not become egotistical,+ stirring up competition with one another,+ envying one another.
