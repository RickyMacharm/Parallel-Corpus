3  I said: “Hear, please, you heads of JacobAnd you commanders of the house of Israel.+ Should you not know what is just? 
 2  But you hate what is good+ and love what is bad;+You tear off the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones.+ 
 3  You also eat the flesh of my people+And strip off their skin,Smashing their bones, crushing them to pieces,+Like what is cooked in a pot,* like meat in a cooking pot. 
 4  At that time they will call to Jehovah for help,But he will not answer them. He will hide his face from them at that time,+Because of their wicked deeds.+ 
 5  This is what Jehovah says against the prophets who are leading my people astray,+Who proclaim ‘Peace!’+ while they bite* with their teeth+But who declare* war against him who puts nothing into their mouths: 
 6  ‘You will have night;+ there will be no vision;+There will only be darkness for you, no divination. The sun will set on the prophets,And the day will turn dark for them.+ 
 7  The visionaries will be put to shame,+And the diviners will be disappointed. All of them will have to cover over the mustache,*For there is no answer from God.’” 
 8  As for me, I am filled with power by the spirit of Jehovah,And with justice and might,To tell to Jacob his revolt and to Israel his sin. 
 9  Hear this, please, you heads of the house of JacobAnd you commanders of the house of Israel,+Who detest justice and who make crooked all that is straight,+
10  Who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with unrighteousness.+ 
11  Her leaders* judge for a bribe,+Her priests instruct for a price,+And her prophets practice divination for money.*+ And yet they lean on Jehovah,* saying: “Is not Jehovah with us?+ No calamity will come upon us.”+ 
12  So because of you,Zion will be plowed up as a field,Jerusalem will become heaps of ruins,+And the mountain of the House* will become like high places in a forest.*+
